11,"'I thought they hated me' - Lyon on Ashes, Lancashire and Bazball","Nathan Lyon is looking to make a big impact with Lancashire Nathan Lyon was heartbroken, but wishes he had allowed himself the time to take it all in. Ten months ago, the Australia off-spinner was limping down the Lord's pavilion steps and into Ashes folklore, his calf shredded and his series over. At that moment, the home crowd stood in spine-tingling applause in a show of respect towards one of England's most formidable opponents. ""My wife, her parents and a good family friend were all in the crowd in tears,"" Lyon tells BBC Sport. ""I probably didn't understand the level of respect that was shown there and then. ""That's something that I'm grateful to be able to look back on and reflect. I always thought the majority of England hates me."" Two days earlier, Lyon had collapsed to the turf, injured in innocuous fashion when retrieving the ball in the deep. He needed wife Emma to help him into the shower and to get dressed, but it never crossed his mind to not bat in Australia’s second innings. ""I was always batting,"" he says. ""People have different jobs and they go to work when they are sick or unwell. There was no decision not to bat. It was always 'no matter how bad I am, I’m going to go'."" This video can not be played Injured Lyon makes extraordinary Ashes cameo When Lyon flew home, Australia were 2-0 up and on the verge of a first Ashes series win in England since 2001. As he watched through the night down under, the 36-year-old saw his team pegged back to 2-2, probably only saved from a 3-2 defeat by the Manchester rain. While the impact of Australia losing the skills of one of the greatest finger spinners of all time was obvious, less tangible but equally important was losing Lyon's combative and competitive character. ""I do believe if I was here it would have been 4-0 to Australia,"" he says, almost proving the point. Lyon is sitting at his adopted home of Old Trafford, now a county cricketer with Lancashire. Not quite a fox in English cricket's hen house, but certainly a double-agent. For Lyon, a stint with the Red Rose is part of the plan to get him on the Ashes tour of 2027, when he will be 39. In return, county cricketers can learn from playing with and against one of the best in the world. This video can not be played Lyon limped off with an apparent calf injury A particular spotlight fell on the Lyon-Lancs deal after left-arm spinner Tom Hartley's England breakthrough on the tour of India. These Aussies, coming over here, bowling our overs and taking our jobs. But holding back Hartley is not Lyon's ambition. ""I'm not here to take Tom's spot,"" says Lyon. ""I'm here to bowl with Tom in a partnership. ""Hopefully I'll be able to pass on a bit of knowledge here and there, but I'm learning from him as well."" There's a lot to unpack with Lyon. As a cricketer, he is a throwback, a classical finger spinner whose orthodox methods could be dropped into any era of the game. With 530 wickets, he is seventh on the all-time list of Test wicket-takers and a run to the 2027 Ashes would push him much higher. Lyon is the former groundsman who became an Australian legend, a man who will be ""mates for life"" with Joe Root after the time they spent playing Adelaide club cricket together. Well known to be a nervous player, Lyon is always assured in front of a microphone. He talks of being ""humble"" as a result of a country upbringing in rural New South Wales and the values instilled in him by his parents. Lyon's journey from groundsman to 500 Test wickets Lyon 'disappointed' by shortened Lancashire stint But he also famously said he wanted to ""end the careers"" of England players before the 2017-18 Ashes and believes the bowling quartet he forms with pacers Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood is the ""best in the world"". With David Warner gone, Lyon is most likely to be Australia's attack dog in the media and, in November, he aimed a foul-mouthed attack at England's divisive 'Bazball' approach. Even now, Lyon is dismissing the England camp's claims that they don't like the term that defines their tactical set-up in the Brendon McCullum era. ""Yeah they do,"" he says. ""I don't mind hearing about it. It's their type of cricket. I just feel like we've been playing entertaining cricket for a number of years now, we just don't need to call it a name to justify it. ""I've seen David Warner score centuries in a session well and truly before Bazball was invented. ""It's up to them to keep doing it now. They've literally got to go at six runs an over otherwise they're not playing Bazball. If you're going to talk about it, you've got to do it."" There was a time when Australian cricketers would pop over to the UK every four years and hand out an Ashes walloping without breaking sweat. Lyon, along with the likes of Warner, Cummins, Starc, Steve Smith, Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin and Shane Watson are now among a generation of highly successful Aussies that have never outright won the urn in the UK. For Lyon, the calf injury of 2023 came after a 2019 when his fumbled run-out of Jack Leach probably cost his side a series win. ""I have been part of two teams that retained the Ashes here, let's not forget about that,"" he points out. ""But, yeah, 100% the bucket-list dreams for me are to win Test series here and in India."" In Australia, it's a different story. In three series, Lyon is 13-0 up on England, who travel down under at the end of 2025 for what is likely to be the finale of the Ben Stokes and McCullum regime. ""I haven't really thought about that Ashes series,"" says Lyon. ""We've got India at home this year and that is one of the biggest series you can be involved in. ""Then again, 18 months doesn't seem that far away. It's going to be special."" The last time they saw him, he was a wounded animal. Next time, England will be in the Lyon's den.

12,'You feel like a god' - the anatomy of a knockout,"'You feel like a god' - the anatomy of a knockout Warning: This article contains reference to depression and suicide. Billy Graham has seen it all in boxing. The 68-year-old made his professional boxing debut as a teenager, but is most famous for steering Ricky 'The Hitman' Hatton through his glory years. As he watches from ringside, he sees where the punches land, but also the innermost thoughts behind them. ""Fighters might say they don't want to hurt their opponent, but let me tell you, when you're in there, you do,"" he says. ""You absolutely do. ""You want to knock them out, you want to keep hitting them until they drop, so they'll stop hitting you and you can get out of that hellhole. ""That's the reality."" It would be easy to presume that delivering a knockout punch is a moment of pure ecstasy, the kind of sensation footballers experience when scoring a goal. But boxing is not football and knocking someone out is not like scoring a goal. The knockout is brutal, final, irreversible - the fate all fighters dread and to which none are immune. I have spent months examining that unique moment for a book, speaking to those on either end of sport’s most compelling, stark division of victor and vanquished. What I found was surprising. Deontay Wilder knocked down Bermane Stiverne three times in the first round of their November 2017 fight For some fighters their ability to deliver a knockout blow is a defining characteristic, part of their DNA. David Haye and Deontay Wilder are two such men. Between them they have won 71 fights, 68 of them by knockout. This is how Haye describes the knockout moment. ""It's a beautiful feeling,"" he says. ""We love the battle but to end the conflict in one fell swoop, the buzz… you can't compete with that. ""I've never found any high that can come close to that."" Wilder takes it a step further. ""You feel like a god. You feel very powerful,"" says the American. ""It's an indescribable feeling. The aftermath of it, it intensifies your feeling."" For fighters like them, boxing is a religion and the knockout is their idol. For others though, the feelings are more ambivalent. ""It's a mixture of emotions and I don't think until you wake up the next day you understand actually what you've done."" That is how Carl Froch describes his feelings after knocking out George Groves in front of 80,000 people at Wembley Stadium in 2014, with what proved to be the final punch he threw as a professional boxer. The build-up to the fight had been marked by animosity, with Groves - who had suffered a controversial loss in the pair’s first meeting six months previously - antagonising Froch at every opportunity. But Froch’s satisfaction was professional, rather than personal, as a huge right hand crumpled Groves to the canvas. ""Your mind's in a mad space,"" he says. ""But once it was stopped, I didn't get too emotional. I was that much in the zone, it was just seek and destroy and when the knockout came I just kind of knew it was coming."" If there is one emotion, it is relief. That is the most common emotion mentioned by fighters. Relief that it's over, that it's not them who now has to suffer the pain and humiliation of defeat, of failure. It was exactly this feeling that Tony Bellew experienced when he knocked out Ilunga Makabu at Goodison Park to become WBC cruiserweight world champion. ""I just kneeled down and cried,"" he says. ""Cried with relief at the fact that everything I'd been saying all these years had come true. It was just the greatest relief of my life. ""It just validated everything I'd been saying, that I was gonna be a world champion. It was the ultimate goal. I'd reached the ultimate goal."" But sometimes that initial surge of relief morphs into something else. Sometimes the relief at seeing an opponent fall, knowing that the fight is over, quickly metamorphoses into a cold and icy fear, born of the realisation that the opponent isn't moving. Jamie Moore experienced this rising dread after knocking out Matthew Macklin in the 10th round of a full-blooded British light-middleweight title bout in 2006. Macklin left the ring on a stretcher, but was released from a local hospital after precautionary checks. Moore cancelled his victory party to visit Macklin in hospital. ""This sport is beautiful and brutal in equal measure because you want to inflict pain on your opponent because that's the only way you're gonna win,"" says Moore. ""But when you do it to that extent, then that scares you. Everyone wants to win but nobody wants to go to that extent. ""So you're trying to find that middle ground. But when you push it to that end of it, it's a scary feeling."" Billy Graham was Macklin’s trainer that night. As he knows, that middle ground is a mirage. It doesn't exist. It can't. Not in a sport like boxing. Any empathy has to wait until the contest is over. But when it comes, it comes easily. Because every winner knows he is only ever a split-second away from swapping places. Francis Ngannou, an MMA champion, lost a controversial split decision against Tyson Fury on his professional boxing debut, before being knocked out by Anthony Joshua In early March, Francis Ngannou was knocked out by Anthony Joshua. Ngannou's legs folded underneath him, more than 19 stone of bone, sinew and muscle going limp. His limbs poured on to the canvas in languid fashion before settling in an almost perfect symmetry; legs stretched out straight in front of him, arms resting neatly at his side, his entire frame flat on its back. Unconscious. He told us later that he didn't feel or remember a thing. Some found that shocking but that's how it is when a fighter gets knocked out cold. The violence of the blow to the brain is so great that there is no chance of a person being able to recall it. Hatton was knocked out by Manny Pacquiao in equally brutal fashion in a Las Vegas super-fight in May 2009. ""I was knocked out cold and then after a couple of minutes you come around,"" he says. ""You wake up and then you realise you're in the ring and that you've been in a fight and you go back to the changing rooms after and then you talk to your coach and ask: 'So what was it? What was the punch that caught me?' ""Then you say 'yeah, yeah, I remember now, that's right' and it just takes you a while to absorb it again."" Hatton's fellow Mancunian Anthony Crolla had a similar experience against Ukrainian wizard Vasiliy Lomachenko in Los Angeles in 2019. With a minute to go in round four, Crolla was deposited face first on the canvas, knocked out. ""I didn't realise until after it, just how bad it looked,"" he says. ""In the dressing room my phone obviously was going mad, people concerned, wanting me to let them know I was OK. ""I feel absolutely fine and I say: 'I don't really understand all of this. I mean it's really nice of people and everything but it's not like it was a really bad knockout.' And the room just went a bit quiet. ""I could see people thinking: 'Ah, awkward, who's gonna tell him?' So I got my phone and watched it and thought: 'Oh.' ""But it was mad because I could remember everything really clearly, how he set me up, the shot he hit me with. ""And I remembered being on the floor, face first, and I remember thinking I must look stupid, but I couldn't move, it was like I'd been Tasered. I was talking to the referee, telling him I was fine and I genuinely was. I just couldn’t move for a little while. ""I was trying my hardest just to roll over but I'd face-planted and couldn't. But that was the feeling; my senses were all there, I just couldn't really move. I could remember it so clearly. And it didn't hurt one bit."" It's an utterly fascinating description; so vivid and detailed as to be utterly convincing. But Crolla's memory, like Hatton's, isn't real. Dr Neil Scott, medical adviser to the British Boxing Board of Control and consultant head and neck surgeon elaborates. ""He may well have been knocked out and then the impact [of face planting] has woken him up,"" Scott says. ""But he's immediately exhibiting signs of a concussion, because he's disorientated, he's trying to start movement, trying to get his balance and get his legs to move but they just won't because the nervous system at that stage is still in shock from the impact. ""There aren't appropriate signals firing from his brain and down his spinal cord to get his limbs moving. ""He may look back and think that he was trying to get his legs up but I suspect that in that moment, if we'd had the benefit of looking at what was actually going on in his brain, even that wasn't even going on."" Anthony Crolla, right, retired a little more than six months after his defeat by Lomachenko, following a final hometown fight in Manchester According to Scott, what Crolla experienced therefore, was more a lucid dream, conjured after the event, than a real memory, Barry McGuigan painted a picture of the phenomenon in his autobiography, recalling a blow he received from the fist of hard-hitting Puerto Rican Juan Laporte in the ninth round of a points victory in 1985. ""When he hit me with that right, I was transported back to when I was a child and used to go to Mrs Keenan's toy shop down the road,"" McGuigan wrote. ""For a split second I thought I was in the toy shop again. I had the sense to grab Laporte, to try and allow my head to clear. It was a bit like when you've been walking along in the rain and get into your car: the windscreen steams up, you put on the fan to clear and it takes a bit of time before you can properly see out again."" As an undefeated rising star with 18 wins to his name, Amir Khan was flattened twice and counted out in just 54 seconds against Breidis Prescott. On each visit to the canvas he felt enveloped in thick, swirling fog, while trying to get his bearings. ""It's the worst place to be,"" he says. ""It's like a jigsaw that has just gone smash, into pieces, and you’re trying to put it back together as quick as possible. That's what it is like. ""You're hearing so many different voices from different people, you're hearing different voices from outside, voices that you recognise, and the referee counting as well and you're thinking: 'Who am I listening to? What should I do?' ""It's a very tough position to be in."" Nobody described this hideous out-of-body experience better than Muhammad Ali. The Greatest described being in that state of not knowing where you are as being on the threshold of the 'Near Room'. Boxing writer George Plimpton related how Ali described the Near Room to him in his classic book Shadow Box: ""A place to which, when he got in trouble in the ring, he imagined the door swung half open and inside he could see neon, orange and green lights blinking, and bats blowing trumpets and alligators playing trombones, and where he could see snakes screaming. Weird masks and actors' clothes hung on the wall, and if he stepped across the sill and reached for them, he knew that he was committing himself to his own destruction."" The Near Room calls to hurt fighters, woos them, but it must be resisted. Appealing though it might appear to be in that strange twilight of semi-consciousness, a fighter has to refuse the temptation to enter that room, to go under, until, as McGuigan described it, the windscreen clears and ""you can see properly out again"", at which point the Near Room will recede into the distance. Breidis Prescott (right) had 17 knockouts from 19 previous fights before facing Amir Khan and proved his punch power once again But there are some knockouts that cannot be resisted and the aftermath can be horrific. The strains of a rendition of Rule Britannia from his travelling army of fans had just died away when a crunching left hand from Pacquiao floored Hatton. It took him a good couple of minutes to get back to his feet. The after-effects lasted a lot longer. Hatton suffered terribly with depression in the wake of his knockout - he was suicidal and attempted to kill himself 'several times'. ""People would say: 'What's he got to be depressed about? Yeah he got beat by Pacquiao, but, look, he's got a nice house, he's got a nice car, he's got this, he's got that, what does he need to be worried about?' But they don't realise the state it leaves you in,"" says Hatton. ""When you're a fighter and a winner, you have to have that belief in yourself and that attitude that no-one can beat you, that you're the best. ""If you're a proud, proud man, a proud boxing champion, you know, it doesn't matter what you put in the bank and how big your house is, it messes you up a bit."" The emphatic manner of the Pacquiao loss cut deep. It was crippling. That is what the knockout can do, the effect it can have. It can steal a vital part of the defeated fighter. Physiologically what is happening in that moment is easier to explain. ""It varies from person to person. But essentially an impact causes a shift or movement of the brain within the skull,"" says Scott. ""The jolting force totally disrupts the nerve signals within the head, and the response is that the system momentarily almost shuts down. ""It's like a protective kind of mechanism, resulting in a temporary loss of consciousness. ""Anyone can be knocked out, it just depends on how difficult that process is going to be."" There are plenty of professionals who've never been knocked out. American legend Marvin Hagler survived some vicious bouts, notably his 1985 war with Thomas Hearns, before retiring without a losing KO on his record. But in Scott's estimation, such a record is, at least partly, down to luck. ""They haven't been exposed to the level of force or that exact 'everything lining up' moment - the 'Swiss cheese effect', external where all the factors come together - that would lead to that knockout for them,"" he says. A knockout will most often occur through ""getting caught with a shot that you aren't fully prepared for"" and because you're not prepared for it ""you haven't got that brace system set up"". When a punch lands on an unprepared opponent, the force transmits through the skull of a fighter more effectively, causing even greater movement of the brain and a correspondingly slimmer chance the recipient has of staying conscious. In boxing we often refer to a fighter's 'chin', referencing their ability to take a punch and not get knocked out. It is an ability that is hard to define. ""We can describe fighters as having a strong chin but they have a lot of other factors counting for them,"" says Scott. ""Maybe have particularly strong neck muscles or they may just not be as prone physiologically to a concussion. ""If you get a firm hit on the chin, the nature of the bottom jaw, the mandible, is that it's a U-shaped bone essentially. The force will be transmitted straight around it, up to your jaw joint and straight to the base of your skull. And the force then dissipates. ""If that happens to you or me, there's a high chance we would break our jaw joints at the point of impact. ""However, in an elite athlete who has strengthened their neck and back and their upper torso, the response is different. The force is better dissipated, because of the reinforcement around the skull."" A knockout punch reverberates far beyond the ring though. Hatton didn't fight again for three and a half years after being knocked out by Pacquiao I have followed boxing since I was a boy. I have been a broadcaster and commentator in the sport for more than a decade. I've seen a lot of knockouts from ringside and I have never become immune or anaesthetised to the pure adrenaline of it. I don't think I ever will. In the late fourth century, philosopher St Augustine wrote of how he visited the colosseum with Alypius of Thagaste, a friend who was morally opposed to the violence of the Roman arena. Alypius was persuaded to go and, after insisting on keeping his eyes closed, he relented and allowed himself to take in his surroundings. This is how St Augustine described his reaction: ""He drank it in, with a savage temper and he did not turn away but fixed his eyes on the bloody pastime, drinking in the madness, delighted with the wicked contest. ""He was now no longer the same man that came in but was one of the mob. He looked, he shouted, he was excited and he took away with him the madness and it stimulated him to come again."" Boxing's violence is not as extreme as the Roman amphitheatre, but the clamour of the crowd is still there. Why do boxers think that the spectacle of watching two people fight still holds such an appeal for the viewing public, most of whom will never set foot inside a ring? What is their attitude to the people who pay to see them stripped to the waist, gloved up and set upon each other? For former WBO cruiserweight champion Johnny Nelson, it was all business, cold and transactional. ""You have disdain for the crowd,"" he says. ""What you've got to do is think for you - you've got to think not about why they're there but instead: 'I'm making money, I'm getting paid for this, because I want to do it. I'm using you, you're not using me.' ""The majority of people who pay money want to see blood, want to see somebody get knocked out, and nine times out of 10 they get that."" Haye is convinced society not only wants that place to exist, but also needs it to. ""It's a natural, human instinct to watch fighting, to watch combat,"" he says. ""A lot of men have that in them. It's buried deep down in many of them, and society softens a lot of men so they get their buzz from fighting through other people. ""Deep down, if their life depended on it, if their family's life depended on it, they'll step up and fight, but we live in such a soft society today that the majority of men never have a fight. ""I think people get their outlet for combat through watching boxing. ""It's a natural thing for a human being, particularly men but now women are starting to see the benefits. I think the more fighting the better, as long as it's controlled - rules, referee, the medical side of it."" Twenty-six of David Haye's 28 professional wins, including his July 2012 success over Derek Chisora, came via knockout As a fighter whose stock in trade is the knockout, British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion Fabio Wardley feels he can't criticise people for craving a spectacle he very much wants to supply. ""As humans, I think that's something we all have,"" he says. “Before a really big knockout, there's like this pause where the rest of the room thinks, 'Wow, that happened,' and then everyone goes mental. Everyone keeps paying to chase that buzz but we as fighters, we're chasing it too. ""Whatever feeling the supporter or fan is getting through watching me or someone else do that, the feeling for me actually doing it is a thousand times bigger. ""I'll turn around and look at the crowd and everyone's on their feet and shouting your name… there's no drug like it."" One addiction, the desire to end the contest, indulges another, the desire to see the end. And its grip shows no signs of weakening.  The Knockout by Andy Clarke is released on 30 May.

13,Beard set to miss Wales summer programme as Morgan returns,"Adam Beard and Jac Morgan both play for Ospreys Lock Adam Beard is set to miss Wales' summer matches because of an ankle injury but World Cup captain Jac Morgan is set to return to action this weekend. Beard, 28, was injured during the Ospreys' 61-24 defeat by Bulls on 27 April after landing awkwardly from a line-out. The British and Irish Lions lock has won 56 caps and has been a regular in Warren Gatland's Wales side during the 2023 World Cup and this year's Six Nations. Wales play South Africa on 22 June at Twickenham before travelling to Australia in July for two Tests in Sydney and Melbourne and a game against Queensland Reds in Brisbane. Morgan is being lined up for his first game of the year in Ospreys' trip to Leinster on Saturday. The flanker has not played since undergoing knee surgery last December. But Ospreys say the back-row, who led Wales to the World Cup quarter-finals last year, is available for selection.

The return of his World Cup co-captains - alongside hooker Dewi Lake - will also be welcome news for Wales head coach Gatland, before the summer internationals. Gatland was without both Morgan and Lake for the entire Six Nations when Exeter's Dafydd Jenkins took over the captaincy. Leicester flanker Tommy Reffell wore Wales' number seven jersey, in a campaign that saw Wales finish bottom of the championship for the first time in 21 years.

14,Lincoln expect Erhahon to generate club-record fee,"Ethan Erhahon has featured 69 times for Lincoln City in all competitions Lincoln City expect Ethan Erhahon to fetch a club-record fee when he is sold in future, but the Imps are in no rush to agree a transfer, says director of football Jez George. The 22-year-old, who joined the Imps from St Mirren in January 2023, was recently voted both the Players' Player and Fans' Player of the Season. Lincoln boss Michael Skubala rates Erhahon as the best defensive midfielder in League One ""by a mile"" and has previously admitted they ""will struggle to hold on to"" the former Scotland Under-21 international this summer. George said approaches from other clubs were expected. ""I don’t think clubs in the Championship will be doing their jobs properly if there wasn’t interest,"" George told BBC Radio Lincolnshire. When asked if Erhahon would likely become the most expensive player ever sold by the club, George said: ""I'd be amazed if he isn't when it happens."" Red Imps Club: Lincoln City Raised expectations 'healthy' for Imps - Skubala Lincoln defender Eyoma to leave club The largest sum Lincoln have generated from a player's transfer is about £640,000 for defender Harry Toffolo - a figure that included his initial move to Huddersfield in January 2020 and the sell-on fee for his later move to Nottingham Forest. With Erhahon having more than two years remaining on his contract, George says the Imps are ""very well protected"" and are not ""in a position where we have to sell"". ""We hoped this would be the situation when we signed Ethan,"" George said. ""He has been exceptional."" But George does admit that bids will be listened to if ""right for everybody"". ""It's about career progression and the right club,"" George said. ""So if the right club comes in with the right financial package for Ethan that could be life changing, quadrupling his wages, and it is an absolutely huge number for Lincoln City - money we can (use to) overall try and strengthen in lots of different areas - then as a football club we have to look at that.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cw0vllxlz25o
15,Chamberlain goes from building site to world stage,"Mark Chamberlain celebrates beating Gavin Gwynne in their WBA Intercontinental lightweight title fight Working a full-time job and being a professional boxer was ""too much"" for Portsmouth-based lightweight Mark Chamberlain. The undefeated WBA Intercontinental lightweight champion was plastering houses only a year ago, struggling to balance working a nine-to-five job with wanting to achieve his dreams. ""It’s not easy finding sponsorship these days,"" Chamberlain told BBC South Today. ""You need to be training two or three times a day. You can’t be working because it’s too much. ""I was getting up at five to do my runs, finishing a day of work and then I wasn’t getting home until near nine at night."" He turned professional 12 months ago and now trains two to three times a day as he looks to take his career to the next level. Acquiring sponsors was something that enabled Chamberlain to do this, letting him quit his job and spend time in the boxing gym without the need to work. The 25-year-old had a major breakthrough in his career when in March he was given a shot to fight on the undercard of Anthony Joshua v Francis Ngannou in Saudi Arabia. 'Thunder' had only fought on smaller shows or arenas such as York Hall, the Copper Box and Wembley Arena a couple of times - suddenly he was fighting at an event watched by millions around the world. Chamberlain dispatched of Gavin Gwynne - who had a 17-1 record - inside four rounds to earn a second invitation to Saudi Arabia, this time to fight Joshua Oluwaseun Wahab on the undercard of the undisputed heavyweight bout between Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk on 18 May. “I treat every fight like a world title fight,” Chamberlain added. “Boxing is a sport where your life is on the line and you can’t afford to make any hiccups.”",https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/c84z22eqjpvo
16,Ireland face Pakistan in T20 World Cup build-up,"George Dockrell was brought into the Ireland set-up as a left-arm spinner in 2010 but has since also developed into a highly effective middle-order batter Ireland  v Pakistan - T20 international series (first of three games) Venue: Castle Avenue, Dublin Date: 10 May Time: 15:00 BST Coverage: Scorecards and match reports on BBC Sport website & app Ireland all-round George Dockrell says the three-match home series against Pakistan over the next week will be ideal preparation for their T20 World Cup challenge which begins in New York against India on 5 June. Irish conditions may not be quite the same as in the Big Apple or Florida where Ireland's four opening World Cup group games will be played. But the Dublin weather looks set to behave at least for Friday's opener although showers are forecast for the contests on Sunday and Tuesday. ""It’s some great cricket to kick off our summer and especially playing at home is fantastic,"" said Dockrell, 31, who broke into the Ireland set-up as a spinner in 2010 but has also since developed into a highly effective middle-order batter. Following the three Pakistan contests at Clontarf, the Irish will be involved in a further four-game T20 tournament in the Netherlands against the hosts and Scotland before they travel to USA. ""We’ve got a fantastic schedule building into the World Cup and really looking forward to the next month and a bit."" The Pakistan games will offer both sides the opportunity to size each other up for their concluding World Cup group game in Florida on 16 June, with the Irish having faced Canada and USA following the opening India contest. Get cricket news sent straight to your phone Dockrell insists the Irish will be aiming for ""wins"" over the next week, even though he says the home side have the height of respect for the opposition. ""They are obviously a great outfit so you are not only being able to express yourself and be playing in that high-level cricket and building towards the World Cup but also you’re able to see one of the oppositions that you will ultimately be playing which is very beneficial,"" added the Dubliner. ""It’s some great cricket to kick off our summer and especially playing at home is fantastic."" But while Ireland have plenty of competitive action before they head to the US, Dockrell acknowledges that excitement is already building about the looming World Cup challenge. The Irish enjoyed a highly successful 2022 tournament in Australia when opening group stages wins over West Indies and Scotland secured a place in the Super 12s where they defeated eventual winners England. The way the fixtures fall, it's possible Ireland's final opening group game against Pakistan could be a shootout for a place in the next stage. ""If we’re in that situation coming into the last game with that chance to qualify, we’ll be in a great spot,"" added the all-rounder.  Dockrell says the prospect of playing cricket on the pitches in the US which have been shipped from Australia is novel. ""It will be really interesting to see how it goes. ""It’s really exciting to have this kind of project taken by the ICC [International Cricket Council] and seeing can they do such an event, with the temporary ground."" Ireland opening games against India and Canada will take place at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York before the Irish move to Florida for their games with the co-hosts and Pakistan. The Irish named their World Cup selection earlier this week with former Ulster rugby wing Ross Adair joining his brother Mark in the 14-man squad who will travel to the USA.

20,"Special report: May 9, mayhem and military trials — a year on","“ISPR sahib, listen to me carefully. Respect is not [confined] to a single institution; respect should be for every single citizen,” thundered then-PTI chief Imran Khan in a video released a little after 11am before departing for the Islamabad High Court on May 9 last year. Policemen escort former prime minister Imran Khan as he arrives at the high court in Islamabad on May 12. — Aamir Qureshi/AFP/File Hours later, he was arrested in the Al Qadir Trust case. The case was irrelevant to his supporters and the development was expected — nevertheless, Imran Khan was “a red line” and so, protests erupted almost immediately. But within hours, they turned into riots that lasted more than 24 hours across Pakistan. When the smoke from torched vehicles and tear gas finally cleared, condemnations poured in and a chase ensued. Nearly 500 first information reports were registered. Thousands were arrested, of whom 105 were handed into military custody weeks, if not days, later. A year on, as of May 9, 2024, 85 of these civilians are still in military custody. At least 10 people lost their lives and hundreds sustained injuries, while approximately 40 public buildings and military installations were damaged, including Lahore Corps Commander’s House (Jinnah House) and Askari Tower in Lahore, General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Office in Faisalabad, FC Fort in Chakdara, Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar, Toll Plaza at Swat Motorway and the Mianwali Air Base. In total, 62 outbreaks of violence were documented, inflicting a loss of Rs2.5 billion on the country, of which, according to the State, Rs1.98 billion in losses were suffered by the army.  To this day, the military says the events were a coordinated attack by the PTI leadership. “Nothing is hidden about May 9. The public, the army and we all have irrefutable evidence. All of us saw this incident unfolding, we all saw how everyone was [brainwashed] against the army, its leadership, agencies and institutions through lies and propaganda,” Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, Maj Gen Ahmed Sharif, said two days before the first anniversary of the May 9 riots. He added that “some political leaders” had issued orders to their supporters on May 9 to selectively target military installations. PTI, meanwhile, is demanding a judicial inquiry into May 9 for the “real culprits” while Imran Khan remains behind bars. Between roughly 2:30pm and 3pm, when Jasmine* (female, age 35-40) received instructions to go home from her office, she opted to return to her house in Cantt, considering it to be the “safest” place in Lahore. “Normally, there would be army personnel at the entrance to Cantt, but that day there was no one there when my car passed through,” she recalled. This is an AI generated image, reflective of the situation in Lahore on May 9. Any resemblance to persons or objects is purely coincidental. Another resident of Cantt, Shazia* (female, age 65-70), was at home when she learnt about Imran’s arrest. Her younger sister, who lived nearby, was out shopping at Liberty Market and called her to inform her that shops were closing. “I was really worried, so I kept calling her to know her whereabouts,” she said. Her sister told her that when she entered the gated society between 3:30pm and 4pm, there was no one present at the checkpoints. Shazia, residing close to Rahat Bakery on Sarwar Road, started hearing the clamour of cars, and screams and shouts of people around 5:30pm. Around 6:15pm, she and her husband went outside their residence to find the source of the nearby commotion. “We had no inkling of what was about to unfold; we were simply standing at Rahat Bakery Chowk out of curiosity,” she explained.  Shortly after, she observed two buses arriving, packed with police officers. They disembarked and then proceeded towards the Corps Commander’s House. Merely five minutes later, she saw the officers rushing back. “There were a few young boys and girls coming from the direction of the Corps Commander’s House. They even threw stones at the police,” she stated. A woman gestures next to a burning police vehicle during a protest after former prime minister Imran Khan’s arrest, in Karachi on May 9. — Reuters/File In the midst of this, Shazia witnessed Tayyaba Raja stepping forward and throwing her dupatta near the chowk, a scene which was captured and shared on social media widely. “The moment she did that, a police officer approached and dragged her by the hair from the chowk towards Shabbir Road,” she recounted. She saw a protester in the driver’s seat of a police van while two others were pushing the vehicle towards the chowk. “At the chowk, they set fire to the police van,” she recounted. Ahmed* (male, age 25-30), a Cantt resident who lives further away from the military installations, was at home that day when calls for protests surfaced online. “My friends and I did go around 2pm or 3pm but then we rushed back when things appeared to be getting out of hand around 5pm to 6pm,” he said. “It seemed as if Lahore had become a war zone.”  Upon returning home, Shazia and her husband continued to hear the commotion until 5am. “We could still hear the sound of gunshots, and there was so much tear gas that even after closing all our windows, my husband had trouble breathing due to his asthma problems.” Not too far away from them, Jasmine also felt her eyes burning around 7pm. Her house was a few minutes’ walk away from the Corps Commander’s House. “I couldn’t understand why my eyes were burning,” she recalled. Through her work group on WhatsApp, she learned of protests erupting inside Cantt. “I was terrified after that day,” said Shazia. For Ahmed, the scenes from May 9 stayed long beyond the day with him; whenever he ventured towards Jinnah House, he felt as if he was being followed. He shrugged it off as paranoia. This is an AI generated image, reflective of the situation in Lahore on May 9. Any resemblance to persons or objects is purely coincidental All of the 10 families that Dawn.com spoke to said the same thing; after the arrest by police and subsequent transfer into military custody, there was silence on the whereabouts of the suspect for at least one or one-and-a-half months. Tariq*, a resident of Lahore, was at work in Lahore’s Gulberg II area when television channels, almost in unison, broke the news of Imran’s arrest on May 9. He barely paid any attention to it though. “We all knew it was going to happen sooner or later.” “But then,” he recalled to Dawn.com, “they started running footage of the protests; everything was burning and within a few minutes, we were told to go back home.” The first thing Tariq did was call his younger brother. The duo, hailing from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla, has been living at a hostel in Lahore for the past few years; one earns while the other studies.

Tariq grew more anxious as dusk settled atop the walled city. After a dozen unanswered calls, he made his way to Liberty Chowk — the nucleus of Lahore and the protests that day — but his brother was nowhere in sight. After a search of four days — which felt excruciatingly longer — he received a call from an unknown number. In the brief conversation that Tariq said skipped the formalities of an introduction, he was told to come to the Lahore Anti-Terrorism Court the next day. Feeling unsure and helpless, he made his way to the overcrowded ATC on May 14. Despite the swarm of families, Tariq spotted his younger brother who stood subdued in a queue of young men. But he couldn’t get close enough to talk to him. In the coming days, Tariq would make multiple visits to the court for his brother but return home alone. And then one day, he got a call from a policeman informing him that his brother was being held at the Camp Jail.  “But when I visited the prison the next day, the officials said he wasn’t there anymore. Upon my insistence, one of the jail officials retrieved a list from his pocket and said my brother had been handed into military custody,” he recalled. “They said he was implicated for attacking the Lahore Corps Commander’s House.” This was the last time he heard about his brother for several days. Salima*, another resident of Lahore, said her son was arrested by “Punjab Police officials and plain-clothed men” from a hospital on the night of May 18. “They said his call data record from May 9 showed he was near the Lahore Corps Commander’s House. “He had just gone out to get some groceries that day,” she insisted. This is an AI generated image depicting a holding cell. Salima said her son was taken to the Factory Area Police Station after the arrest and presented before an ATC the next day. “He was then shifted to the Camp Jail. But when we went to meet him there, we were told that he had been handed over into the custody of the army,” she told Dawn.com. Then came the silence. Sultan*, whose son has been in military custody for more than 352 days, said he feels more helpless every passing day. “I searched for him tirelessly … went from one police station to the other. And then I thought that ’agar zinda hoga to wapis ajayega (he will come back if alive)’,” the father said. He eventually found out that his son was arrested on May 21 for allegedly attacking the FC Fort in Lower Dir. “The police said they had a photograph of him inside the building,” Sultan said, adding that he didn’t hear about his son for over a month after the arrest. “I have been driving cement trucks for a year to make ends meet … I am tired now,” the octogenarian father said. Both Tariq and Salima, like other families Dawn.com spoke to, received a call from the military more than — at least — 30 days later after the accused was handed into military custody for investigation. They were given a time and location for a meeting with the accused and told to engage a lawyer. “We were allowed to meet for 15 minutes in the presence of uniformed officers,” Tariq said**. “My brother looked very weak … sunken eyes and a bony face … I could barely recognise him.” The meeting, he described, was held inside a small room with a few chairs and a desk. “When my brother was brought inside the room, his face was covered with a black cloth and his hands were cuffed at the back. The cloth eventually came off and so did the handcuffs, but the officials never left the room.” Hamza*, a resident of KP’s Chakdara, recalled a similar setting from the first meeting with his brother, who is in military custody in Malakand**. He was led towards a room after meandering his way through the checks. “A few minutes later, two officers brought my brother — his face covered with a black cloth — inside. He had lost a lot of weight and his usually trimmed beard now resembled a bush,” Hamza told Dawn.com. His brother was arrested from outside their family’s shop on May 22 for allegedly attacking the FC Fort in Lower Dir and was handed into military custody a week later. “The police said they had a video in which he could be seen inside the building … he had not even touched or damaged anything,” he insisted. Several protesters forced entry into the Lahore Corps Commander’s house and vandalised it, later setting fire to the furniture. — Reuters/File Sultan got a call 33 days after his arrest, and found out his son was in Peshawar. Soon afterward, the father and son were reunited, albeit briefly, as their meetings began** — first in Timergarah, now in Malakand. Recalling their first meeting, Sultan said his son had lost weight, had dark circles and an overgrown beard. “My heart was crying when I saw him,” he said. These meetings, as the families told Dawn.com, have since continued once a week. Sometimes, video calls are also allowed. Initially, food from outside the prison was not allowed, but that restriction has been removed now. On April 8, the federal government revealed to the Supreme Court that 20 persons who were arrested and convicted for their involvement in the May 9 violence had been released so that they could celebrate Eidul Fitr with their families after they served a major part of their sentence while the remaining period of their punishment was remitted by the army chief. Among them, four belonged to KP while all other 16 hailed from Punjab. It said 20 persons were awarded sentences of one year, of which 17 had served a period of 10.5 months and three persons had served a period of 9.5 months. While none of the persons served a full period of one year, upon confirmation of their sentence, the remaining period of their punishment was remitted by the chief of army staff (COAS) under Section 143(1)(i) of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952. This development has given families of the remaining persons in custody hope while battling their frustration. The trials of Hamza and Tariq’s brothers as well the other accused have concluded. According to Attorney-General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, military courts have completed recording of evidence and have to announce orders, but can not do so in view of the restraining order passed by the apex court to not convict or acquit any suspect until the pendency of government-instituted intra-court appeals. The families, however, have no knowledge of what went on inside the military courts nor have they been provided with any case-related documents. “No paper/file was allowed to enter or exit those fenced boundaries,” said Rehana*, whose husband has been in the army’s custody in Lahore for almost a year now. The reason behind the secrecy surrounding the trials is the Official Secrets Act, a colonial-era law that deals with the disclosure of information and espionage under which the accused have been charged. This was corroborated by the request for custody of civilians sent to courts by the military. Section 2(1)(d) of the Army Act grants the military powers to try civilians accused of “seducing or attempting to seduce any person from duty or allegiance to government” or having committed an offence under the Official Secrets Act. But before that, permission needs to be taken from a court for custody, as mentioned in the Code of Criminal Procedure.  Those written applications which Dawn.com has seen, submitted by the military in courts seeking custody of civilians, stated that the suspects “are found guilty of offences under sections 3, 7 and 9 of the Official Secrets Act, 1923 read with Section 2(1)(d) of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952”.  The courts had subsequently accepted the request under Section 549(3) of the CrPC and directed the jail authorities to hand over the suspects to the army. Before the military trial of a civilian commences, the commanding officer (CO) submits a request to the sessions judge seeking the custody of the suspects. “An investigation report, prepared by the police, is also presented in court after which the judge approves the transfer of custody,” retired Lt Col advocate Inamur Rahim said, elaborating that the general officer commanding (GOC) of the area — who already has a warrant issued by either the army chief or the federal government — then constitutes the military court. Under the Army Act and Article 10A (right to fair trial) of the Constitution, the accused is supposed to be given the choice to appoint a counsel, who is provided a charge sheet and “summary of evidence” 24 hours before the trial begins. Similarly, during the trial, the prosecution’s witnesses appear in court and the defence has the right of both cross-examination and presenting witnesses. Once the proceedings conclude, the verdict is reserved. The president then puts it down on paper with the sentencing. The accused is told “guilty or not guilty” in the next hearing. The document is then sent to the convening authority for confirmation after which the accused, in the final hearing, is told the sentencing. Advocate M, who has represented three accused in military custody, elaborated further on the covertness of the trial. “Before the proceedings began, I was given clear instructions that the details of the hearing could not be disclosed in public,” he said. This is also mentioned in Section 14 (Exclusion of public from proceedings) of the Official Secrets Act, which states: “In addition and without prejudice to any powers which a Court may possess to order the exclusion of the public from any proceedings if, in the course of proceedings before a Court against any person for an offence under this Act or the proceedings on appeal, or in the course of the trial of a person under this Act, the application is made by the prosecution, on the ground that the publication of any evidence to be given or of any statement to be made in the course of the proceedings would be prejudicial to the safety of the State, that all or any portion of the public shall be excluded during any part of the hearing, the Court may make an order to that effect, but the passing of sentence shall, in any case, take place in public.” Same is the case with documents. No one, not even the lawyers, is supposed to be given the case file — which includes the charge sheet and evidence. “We were shown the papers but were not allowed to take them home, get photocopies or even take pictures,” Advocate M recalled. “At most, they allow you to take important notes in a diary. But that is it,” he said. All the 10 lawyers Dawn.com reached out to recounted a similar experience. They shared that when first called by the military, the defence counsels were asked to bring three documents with them: identity card, power of attorney and bar licence. None of the lawyers Dawn.com spoke to commented on the proceedings due to procedure. Advocate A, who represented two people in military custody in Lahore, said the accused and their families were asked if they wanted to appoint a lawyer. “If they said no, the army appointed an ‘accused’s friend’, a major who would represent the civilian in the trial. “But for those who chose to get a lawyer of their choice, they provided the names of the same to the CO who would then call the nominated counsel and ask them if they were willing to represent the accused. Upon saying yes, we were given a time and location where the trial was going to be held,” he said.  At the location**, he continued, the lawyers were first given a briefing on the rules and regulations of the trial after which the proceedings commenced. The rest of the procedure, the lawyers said, was almost similar to that of a civilian trial. “On the first day of the hearing, charges are read out loud and the accused is asked if he pleads guilty or not. Even if the latter’s response is guilty, the trial commences on the presumption of innocence,” Advocate A told Dawn.com. Next comes the cross-examination of witnesses following which the final arguments occur and the verdict is then reserved. But unlike civilian courts where cases are generally drawn out, these military trials were speedy and were wrapped up in less than 10 hearings, with the verdicts now awaited. A demonstrator uses a slingshot during a protest against the arrest of then-PTI chairman Imran Khan, in Islamabad on May 10. — AFP/File Most of the families and lawyers Dawn.com reached out to claimed that the accused were met with stringent conditions behind bars. Unlike civilian jails where prisoners are allowed outside their cells from sunrise to sunset, the people in military detention were only taken out of their cells twice a day, for 15 minutes, in the presence of a military personnel. It should be noted that during Supreme Court hearings on military trials in June and July, the AGP had toldthe court that all those in custody were being provided health facilities and were “kept in military units, not with hardened criminals”. Advocate R, who represented three persons in military custody, stated that all of the accused wanted to be shifted to civilian prisons. He also claimed that most of the accused persons were those whose videos or photos inside army installations had gone viral. “Most of them were never involved in arson or rioting in the first place,” he alleged. Advocate M doubled down on the claim that people handed over into military custody were not directly involved in the acts of violence. Advocate X, who has fought cases in military courts, gave a “simple explanation” for the way people were handed over into military custody. “It needs to be understood that a military court is not meant to try ordinary civilians; it is either for the enemies or the army’s own people suspected of treason. “It appears that the military did not have SOPs for civilians on such trials, so they followed the same procedures that are used to try their own men,” he said. Other lawyers concurred.  Interestingly, the Official Secrets Act was amended in August 2023, nearly two months after most of the arrests had been made. On August 1 last year, the coalition government, just days before the completion of its five-year term, quietly got a bill to amend the century-old Secrets Act approved by the National Assembly. It was tabled in the lower house of the Parliament through a supplementary agenda on private members’ day — when bills are moved by members in their personal capacity and not ministers alone — through a supplementary agenda and was passed the same day despite protests from both sides of the aisle. The bill was subsequently tabled in the upper house of the Parliament the next day where it was again met with fierce opposition. However, the Senate chairman referred it to the relevant standing committee even though lawmakers demanded that the proposed legislation be put to vote as they wanted to reject it. Finally, on Aug 6 — a Sunday — the bill to amend the Official Secrets Act, 1923, was passed by the Senate, albeit with a few changes to the original amendments made by the standing committee. After securing the approval of the Senate, the ‘amended’ bill was again presented in the NA on Aug 7. This time, it sailed through the lower house. Now, the bill only needed the president’s assent to become a law. On Aug 19, it had emerged that the president at that time, Dr Arif Alvi, had given his assent to the bills to amend the Official Secrets Act and the Army Act. However, in a startling turn of events, Alvi denied assenting to the changes in the laws in a post on social media platform X. “As God is my witness, I did not sign Official Sec­rets Amendment Bill, 2023 and Pakistan Army Ame­ndment Bill, 2023 as I disagreed with these laws,” the president said in his tweet. Hours after Alvi’s statement, a gazette notification issued by the Senate Secretariat surfaced, stating that the two bills were “deemed to have been assented by the president”. Alvi’s allegations, on the other hand, stand where they are. They haven’t been taken up in any court yet. It must be noted that Section 3 of the Official Secrets Act, which appears to be the main provision under which the accused in military custody have been charged, was renamed from “penalties for spying” to “offences”, with the addition of photography through drone cameras of prohibited areas as a crime. Other changes made to the law included the broadening of the definition of military installations and bringing digital and modern means of communication into the act’s ambit. Moreover, clauses related to prohibited areas were also amended and it would be an offence if someone was to “access, intrude, approach or attack any military installation, office, camp office or part of building”. Earlier, the offence was restricted to such movement during the time of war only; however, the amendment has expanded this to peacetime as well. Similarly, the definition of “enemy” introduced in the law states: “Any person who is directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally working for or engaged with a foreign power, foreign agent, non-state actor, organisation, entity, association or group guilty of a particular act… prejudicial to the safety and interest of Pakistan.” The new amendments also empowered the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and officials of intelligence agencies to investigate suspects for violation of the Official Secrets Act. It states: “An investigating officer under this act shall be an officer of the Federal Investigation Agency not below the rank of BPS-17 or equivalent. The said officer shall be designated by the Director General [of] FIA for the purpose of investigation. If the Director General [of] FIA deems necessary, he may constitute a joint investigation team (JIT), convene by such officer and consisting [of] such other officers of intelligence agencies as he may appoint.” The JIT is supposed to complete the investigation in 30 working days and the challan would be submitted to the special court through a public prosecutor. The law also deals with the admissibility of the evidence and states: “All material collected during the course of inquiry or investigation, including electronic devices, data, information, documents, or such other related material, which facilitates the commission of any offence under this act, shall be admissible.” A mere perusal of the amendments suggests that they were drafted while keeping in mind the May 9 violence. “A person cannot be charged and punished under a law in retrospective effect,” Advocate B said. “These trials undermine civilian courts and trust in the judiciary. It will set an extremely dangerous precedent if allowed.” Anchorperson Hafeezullah Niazi, father of prominent PTI leader in military custody Hassaan Niazi, was of a similar opinion. “How can it be that the judge, jury and the prosecutor are all from the army?” he asked. “We don’t know what to do, or who to reach out for appeals. My son is stuck in this tug of war between the military and Imran Khan,” the father rued. The lawyers Dawn.com spoke to said that the verdict can be challenged in an army appellate court within 40 days of the judgment. The army chief or an officer of the brigadier rank (assigned by the COAS) decides on the appeal. Once a decision is taken there, the aggrieved can approach the high court but with a petition that challenges the constitutionality/framework of military trials. There is no scope for a direct appeal. Section 133B of the Army Act says: (1) Any person to whom a court-martial has awarded a sentence of death, imprisonment for life, imprisonment exceeding three months, or dismissal from the service after the commencement of the Pakistan Army (Amendment) Act, 5 [1992], may, within forty days from the date of announcement of finding or sentence or promulgation thereof, whichever is earlier, prefer an appeal against the finding or sentence to a Court of Appeals consisting of the Chief of the Army Staff or one or more officers designated by him in this behalf, presided by an officer not below the rank of Brigadier in the case of General Court-Martial or Field General Court Martial or District Court-Martial or Summary Court-Martial convened or confirmed or countersigned by an officer of the rank of Brigadier or below as the case may be, and one or more officers, presided by an officer not below the rank of Major General in other cases, hereinafter referred to as the Court of Appeals: Provided that where the sentence is awarded by the court-martial under an Islamic law, the officer or officers so designated shall be Muslims: Provided further that every Court of Appeals may be attended by a judge advocate who shall be an officer belonging to the Judge Advocate General’s Department, Pakistan Army, or, if no such officer is available, a person appointed by the Chief of the Army Staff. (2) A Court of Appeals shall have power to — (a) accept or reject the appeal in whole or in part; or (b) substitute a valid finding or sentence for an invalid finding or sentence; or (c) call may witness, in its discretion for the purpose of recording additional evidence in the presence of the parties, who shall be afforded an opportunity to put any question to the witness; or (d) annul the proceedings of the court-martial on the ground that they are illegal or unjust; or (e) order retrial of the accused by a fresh court; or (f) remit the whole or any part of the punishment or reduce or enhance the punishment or commute the punishment for any less punishment or punishments mentioned in this Act. (3) The decision of a Court of Appeals shall be final and shall not be called in question before any court or other authority whatsoever. However, in his press conference on June 26, the army’s spokesperson, Maj Gen Ahmed Sharif Chau­dhry, had said that the accused being tried by the military were entitled to legal rights, including the right to have a lawyer of their choice and the right to appeal before the high courts and the Supreme Court. Retired Lt Col Rahim told Dawn.com that while an appeal against the verdict can be filed within 40 days, the process was not as simple; the army’s court of appeal is established under its own hierarchy. For example, if a brigadier or major general has announced a verdict, the head of the appellate court would be a lieutenant general. However, he continued, it is high time now that an “independent” court of appeals comprising “judicial minds” is formed. “When the British Army returned from India after World War II in 1945, they were given a right of appeal. For that, a court of appeals comprising retired judges was formed. The army could indeed punish its own, but the appeals would be heard by an appellate court comprising people of judicial minds because military courts are command-oriented. “Naturally, even members of the appellate courts look towards the command for their career development. And if the command has given a decision, it would be very difficult for them to say something different than that. Therefore, it was decided that the appellate court should be independent of the command,” he elaborated. This practice, Rahim said, was also adopted by other Commonwealth countries. Protesters clash with police following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan in Peshawar on May 10. — AFP/File Supreme Court’s Justice Ayesha A. Malik, in her concurring note in the military trials case, terms the absence of an independent right to appeal one of the “glaring issues that arise within a military, from which it is clear that there is a lack of impartiality and independence within a military trial and the concept of fairness and due process is missing from the procedure”. “The basic principle of the independence of the judiciary is that everyone is entitled to be tried by the ordinary courts or tribunals established under the law and the trial of a citizen by a military court for an offence which can be tried before the courts established under Article 175 (Establishment and Jurisdiction of Courts) of the Constitution offends the principles of independence of the judiciary and of fair trial,” she highlighted. “In terms of the constitutional guarantee of fair trial and due process, the trial of a civilian before a military court does not meet the requirements” of the fundamental right provided under Article 10-A of the Constitution, Justice Ayesha noted. According to Inamur Rahim, who was also formerly attached with the military’s JAG [Judge Advocate General] branch, the trial of an accused person, as per the military rules, should begin within eight days of being handed into custody. “If, for some reason, the trial doesn’t begin, then the commanding officer [every area/jurisdiction has a CO] has to prepare an ‘eighth-day delay report’ and give reasoning. If eight more days pass, then the brigade commander has to write a report.” Section 74 of the Army Act states: “Every commanding officer shall take care that a person under his command when charged with an offence is not detained in custody for more than forty-eight hours after the committal of such person into custody is reported to him, without the charge being, investigated, unless investigation within that period seems to him to be impracticable having due regard to the public service. Every case of a person detained in custody beyond a period of forty-eight hours and the reason therefore shall be reported by the commanding officer to the officer to whom application is to be made to convene a general or District court martial for the trial of the person charged: Provided that in reckoning the period of forty-eight hours all public holidays shall be excluded.” Section 75: “In every case where any such person as is mentioned in Section 73 (Custody of offenders) as is not on active service remains in custody for a longer period than eight days, without a court martial for his trial being ordered to assemble, a special report giving reasons for the delay shall be made by his commanding officer in the manner prescribed and a similar report shall be forwarded at intervals of eight days until a court martial is assembled or such person is released from custody.” Rahim said “if the trial still does not begin for some reason, then the matter will go to the General Officer Commanding (GOC) who will write a report after 24 days”. “If the trial doesn’t begin after 32 days, a report titled ‘32 days delay report’ is prepared … the commanding officer will go to the accused and prepare a petition on the latter’s behalf which would be sent to the judge advocate general,” explained Rahim. “The judge advocate will go through the petition and, if he deems it fit, will order the accused’s release subject to re-arrest,” he added. In the case of the May 9 trials, while at least 102 people were in custody of the military by June 23, the trials hadn’t begun according to the AGP on June 27 as the “cases were at the investigation stage”. These comments were made during a Supreme Court hearing after several petitions challenging the trials of civilians in military courts were brought to the apex court by former CJP Jawwad S. Khawaja, Aitzaz Ahsan, Karamat Ali, Imran Khan and others. Former CJP Khawaja argued that Section 2(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Pakistan Army Act were inconsistent with constitutional fundamental rights and should be invalidated, seeking a suspension of proceedings against civilians based on these sections. Ahsan aimed to prevent civilians arrested for involvement in the May 9 violence from being tried in military courts. Imran sought a declaration against the arrest, investigation, and trial of civilians under specific laws during peacetime. Earlier the same month, a nine-member bench, headed by then-CJP Umar Ata Bandial, was formed to hear the pleas. After Justice Qazi Faiz Isa expressed dissatisfaction with the bench’s composition, a seven-member bench resumed hearing the petitions. The revised proceedings concluded with Justice Bandial directing the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan to provide a list of individuals detained under various laws relating to the May 9 violence. On June 23, the AGP informed the court that 102 individuals were held in military custody, adding that no women, juveniles, advocates, or journalists were among them. Dawn.com reached out to the AGP for further understanding, but he said he could not comment because the matter is sub judice. Women holding ‘red line’ posters: Supporters of former prime minister Imran Khan shout slogans as they block a road during a protest against the arrest of their leader in Hyderabad on May 9. — Akram Shahid/AFP/File On June 26, Justice Bandial said: “I expect that no military trial [of civilians] will be conducted while proceedings are ongoing.” ISPR DG Maj Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, on the other hand, in a presser later in the day, mentioned that proceedings against the 102 people handed over for trial under the army act were already underway. He also revealed the military had sacked three officers — including a lieutenant general — and concluded disciplinary proceedings against 15 officers, including three major generals and seven brigadiers, over the events of May 9. However, when the court reconvened the following day on June 27, the AGP informed the court that trials of civilians in military custody had not yet commenced as the cases were still under investigation. He assured the court that none of them would face charges that could lead to capital punishment or lengthy sentences. Subsequently, CJP adjourned the hearing indefinitely. The hearing resumed 20 days later on July 18. A day before the hearing, the federal government asserted that trying individuals involved in May 9 incidences under the Army Act was an “appropriate” response. However, CJP Bandial observed that subjecting civilians to military courts’ procedures contradicted their constitutional rights, highlighting concerns about the lack of transparency and judicial review in military court verdicts. Even though, in the next hearing on July 19, the apex court allowed the AGP to seek new instructions from the government regarding the provision of appeal against sentences handed down by military courts to those found guilty, the CJP stated that military trials should not start without informing the SC — a point the AGP assured the court of on August 3. The court then postponed further proceedings for an indefinite period. Finally, on Oct 23, in a widely hailed judgement, the apex court declared the military trials of civilians, for their alleged role in attacks on army installations, unconstitutional by a majority of 4-1. Led by Justice Ijazul Ahsan, the bench emphasised that such cases should be tried in criminal courts. The ruling deemed provisions of the Pakistan Army Act related to these trials as “unconstitutional” and without legal effect. The people, however, remained in military custody until Dec 13 when the SC suspended the operation of its previous Oct 23 order that had deemed the military trial of 103 civilians unconstitutional, in a majority decision of 5-1. This allowed the trials to begin. The appeals, seeking suspension of the earlier order, were filed by various federal and provincial authorities. According to Advocate B, as soon as the SC declared military trials of civilians unconstitutional, “the custody of the civilians by law should have been immediately handed over to ordinary courts”. “During the two-month period, a number of writ petitions were filed in the Lahore High Court by various family members seeking the transfer of these suspects into civilian custody. But the high courts said they could not decide on them because the matter was being heard in the SC.” Earlier this year, on January 28, a six-judge bench resumed hearings on civilians’ military trials. A petition was filed to bar governments from hiring private counsel while Justice Sardar Tariq Masood referred appeals in the military court case back to a three-judge committee for a larger bench reconstitution due to concerns about bench formation under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023. The court ordered the AGP to furnish the details of the verdicts reserved by the military courts by March 28 after former CJP Khawaja, one of the petitioners challenging the military trials, requested an early hearing of the appeals, contending that the continued presence of civilians in military custody was “beyond compensation”. On March 28, SC conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce reserved verdicts, directing that judgements be announced in cases in which the nominated suspects could be released before Eid. In the most recent hearing on April 24, the apex court referred a set of appeals back to a three-judge committee to form a larger bench. Senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui also requested the court to order the federal government to place on record the orders passed by the military trial court for the perusal of the apex court, adding that 85 accused were still under detention and therefore it required urgent hearing into the matter to decide their fate. More than 365 days later, when the country witnessed one of the most widespread agitation against the state in its modern history, the highest court in the country is deliberating on the constitutionality of military courts, the families of the remaining 85 accused are desperately awaiting some good news, and the rest of Pakistan is watching with almost a pin-drop silence around these trials. The question remains: what will these trials come to mean for the country’s judicial system? *Names concealed to protect privacy **Location concealed Header animation generated by Meta.ai",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279/special-report-may-9-mayhem-and-military-trials-a-year-on
21,7 barbershop workers from Punjab shot dead in late-night attack in Gwadar’s Surbandar,"Seven barbershop workers were killed and one was injured on Thursday in Surbandar, Gwadar when unknown gunmen entered their residential quarters and opened fire on them while they were sleeping, police officials said. Speaking to Dawn.com, Gwadar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Zohaib Mohsin said the incident took place at approximately 3am, adding that the victims worked at a barber shop in Surbandar, which is some 25 kilometres from Gwadar. According to a list of the casualties shared with Dawn.com by the SSP, the victims hailed from Punjab’s Khanewal and Lodhran districts, while the injured belongs to Mian Channu, Khanewal. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far. AFP quoted Muhammad Mohsin, a senior police official in Gwadar, as saying: “We are investigating the matter at the moment but apparently it looks like they were attacked because they were Punjabis.” Following the incident, the police shifted the injured person and bodies of the deceased to Gwadar Hospital, SSP Mohsin said. He added that the area was cordoned off by law enforcement as action had begun to find the miscreants. According to Gwadar Deputy Commissioner Hamoodur Rehman, the bodies have been shifted to their native areas via four ambulances. The injured has also been shifted to Karachi after medical aid was administered to him, he added. Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti condemned the killing of the workers in Gwadar, calling it “open terrorism”. He expressed his condolences to their families and said that their families would not be abandoned, vowing to provide all possible support to the families. “We will chase after terrorists and their facilitators,” Bugti said, adding that there is no soft corner or place for them in Pakistan. “Whatever force is needed against the terrorists will be used,” the chief minister said. He stressed that the writ of the state would be enforced in any case. “Every single drop of the blood of Pakistanis will be accounted for,” he said. Prime Minsiter Shehbaz Sharif condemned the incident and expressed his condolences to the victims’ families, according to a statement on X by state broadcaster PTV News. “This incident of terrorism is a cowardly act of the enemies of the country. We are determined to eradicate terrorism from its roots,” the statement read.  Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi echoed similar sentiments, expressing deep sorrow and condolences over the killing of the seven labourers. “The beasts who play with the lives of the innocent don’t deserve to be called humans,” Naqvi said in a statement shared by the Ministry of Interior on X.  Balochistan Home Minister Mir Zia Ullah Langau said the terrorists will be dealt with strictly. He noted that a report of the incident has been called for, and the incident is being reviewed from all aspects. “The killing of innocent labourers is a cowardly act,” he said, adding that the terrorists will be brought to justice. Meanwhile, the Balochistan government also condemned the killing and called it “open terrorism”, according to a spokesperson. Administrative officers reached the site of the incident and were in touch with district administration, the spokesperson said. Families of the deceased are being contacted, the spokesperson added. An investigation into the incident has been ordered, the spokesperson noted. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the incident, saying the “brutal killing of innocent workers is open terrorism,” according to a statement on X from the party’s official account. “The people of the entire country, including Balochistan, are extremely angered by this barbarity; humanity is ashamed,” the post read. The beasts involved in the crime should be brought to justice, Bilawal said, adding that Pakistan is committed to the complete eradication of terrorism.

22,Real aim of May 9 riots was to ‘end democracy’ in Pakistan: PM Shehbaz,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that the violent May 9 riots last year after former premier Imran Khan’s arrest were aimed at ending democracy in Pakistan and establishing an “individual’s dictatorship”. “The real aim of May 9 [incidents] was to end democracy in Pakistan and god forbid, bury the Constitution, and a nefarious goal of establishing kingship and dictatorship of an individual,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing a special meeting of the federal cabinet at Parliament House. Imran’s arrest on May 9 last year in the £190m graft case had resulted in widespread violence and saw important military installations come under attack, on the basis of which the state had launched a severe crackdown against his party.  While Imran was released a few days later (he has since been rearrested in a separate case), thousands of PTI workers and almost the entire top-tier leadership were rounded up, with many still facing court proceedings under serious charges. Addressing the federal cabinet, PM Shehbaz said the aim of convening the meeting at Parliament House was to send a message to the nation that “not only will we remember our martyrs and their families till the day of judgment but also to give a message of unity with them”. “The impure plan of May 9 was not just a rebellion against Pakistan but against the state, the Pakistan Army and army chief Gen Asim Munir,” the premier said. “I think that these anti-state elements are displaying the worst enmity in the guise of a friend and a sympathiser,” he asserted.  He recalled various steps taken by the then-coalition government to save the country from economic default and improve relations with brotherly countries. The premier linked the May 9 attacks to the various corruption cases against Imran and his party. He highlighted that politicians in Pakistan’s history had gone through “strict tribulations” and suffered in jail yet raised the slogan of “Pakistan khappay” and said they “could not even think of saying a word against Pakistan”. PM Shehbaz said the riots were “not only a planned conspiracy […] but a rebellion against the institutions and Pakistan to divide the country’s public and make them fight [among themselves]”. The premier stated that the attacks were aimed at “breaking apart unity in Pakistan and ending the public’s emotions of affection for the army and spreading civil war through rebellion”, adding the plan for it failed. Noting that despite a year passing, the suspects involved could not yet be brought to justice and be punished, PM Shehbaz said it was a “stinging question that the entire nation asks itself, us and the institutions, who have been given this responsibility”. Earlier today, PM Shehbaz said there “can absolutely be no soft-pedalling” of the May 9 riots. “There can absolutely be no soft-pedalling of what happened on May 9 and there can be no absolution for those who orchestrated, supported, and assisted the attempt to damage the foundations of our nation,” he said in a post on X.  The premier said that “not only were symbols of our national pride and honour attacked but the sanctity of our sacred homeland was also assaulted” on that day. “Let not the shadows of lies, hide the light of truth,” the prime minister stated. “Love of our country demands nothing less,” PM Shehbaz added while using the hashtag “May 9 Never Again”. In another post last night, the premier had said the day “separated two thoughts of politics — those who sacrificed politics for the state and those who attacked the state for politics”.  “On the one hand, there are the great sons of the nation who shed their blood for their homeland, their great families, and the patriotic public. On the other, there are those characters burning in the fire of hatred, who neither have any pain in their heart for state interests nor have any respect or nobility for national monuments, state institutions, the Constitution or the law,” he added.  PM Shehbaz further said that a year had passed since the events but “Pakistan and the nation have neither forgotten nor will forget their criminals”. “It is [my] pledge to the holy land, the great martyrs, their families and the nation that May 9 never again,” the prime minister vowed. He expressed his resolve to move forward towards development to give a bright future to future generations. Meanwhile, the military’s media affairs wing highlighted that bringing the “real culprits of May 9 [riots] to justice” was paramount to ensure no future desecration of the memories of the country’s heroes. “Bringing the real culprits of May 9 to justice is paramount to ensure that in future, no one dares to desecrate the memories of our heroes and the symbols of our unity through such an unwarranted conduct in future,” the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement. The armed forces, along with the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and services’ chiefs, strongly condemned the “criminal acts” perpetrated on May 9 last year, terming the day as a “Black Day”. Recalling the incident, it said “politically motivated and brainwashed miscreants, in an act of rebellion, deliberately resorted to violence against state institutions and vandalised sacred symbols of the state and the sites belonging to national heritage”. “It was a futile attempt to bring about a misplaced and shortsighted revolution in the country,” the ISPR stated. “By displaying utmost restraint during this deliberate and brazenly orchestrated violence, Pakistan Armed Forces thwarted the insidious conspiracy by the planners, facilitators and executors who wanted to destabilise Pakistan by inciting confrontation between the people and the armed forces,” the statement added. It further said that upon “failing to undermine national harmony and stability”, those involved then “embarked upon a sinister campaign of hate against the armed forces and the state with an intent to twist the narrative to their advantage and shift the blame on the state institutions”. “It is precisely for this reason there can neither be any compromise with the planners, facilitators and executors of May 9 tragedy nor they would be allowed to hoodwink the law of land,” the military asserted. It renewed the resolve to “defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan and defeat nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan, both external and internal”. Recognising the martyrs and their families as the pride of Pakistan, the armed forces pledged to “uphold their dignity and respect at all costs”. “Today, let’s join hands to strongly denounce the conspiracies to weaken Pakistan and work together for the prosperity and stability of our beloved country,” the ISPR said. As the government observed the anniversary of the May 9 riots, political leaders held press conferences throughout the day and issued statements to strongly condemn the violent events. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said the nation would “neither forget nor forgive” the May 9 attacks, *emphasising that bringing the plotters to justice was necessary. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari condemned the May 9 incidents as “yet another dark chapter in the nation’s history”.  In a statement issued last night, the PPP MNA termed the riots a “malevolent scheme aimed at sowing chaos and enforcing fascism in the country”, asserting that justice must prevail for the perpetrators who attacked military installations. He said the “instigator behind the strongly condemnable events of May 9 is well-known to everyone”. The coalition government ally, however, said his party supported the PTI’s demand for a judicial inquiry into the incident, which should be overseen by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa. Bilawal emphasised that for the probe to occur, “all parties, including the PTI, must commit to accepting whatever decision the judicial commission arrives at”. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that a resolution regarding the May 9 violence would be passed in the federal cabinet’s special meeting while the law ministry would also present a “white paper”. Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Tarar said that the PPP, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) and the National Party (NP) have been invited to the meeting as special invitees to represent the coalition partners.  “For the sake of political and personal interests, a move was made on May 9 [last year], which was never done even by the enemies”, the minister added. He said that in his opinion, “a lot of concessions” have been given despite Imran’s nephews and all three sisters being allegedly involved in the riots. The information ministry will also organise a special function — to be addressed by the premier — at the Jinnah Convention Centre in which people from all walks of life have been asked to “pay befitting homage to our glorious martyrs and their families”. Separately, the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), in collaboration with the ISPR, will organise a special prayer ceremony at Radio Pakistan in Peshawar in connection with the May 9 incidents, the state broadcaster reported. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi will be the chief guest while children from different schools in Peshawar will also participate in the ceremony, it said. Another programme regarding the May 9 events will take place at the Pak-China Friendship Centre in Islamabad, which will be broadcast live by Radio Pakistan, the report added. As it aims to mark the first anniversary of the May 9 violence that largely targeted military installations and monuments of martyrs, the government has decided to commemorate the day in solidarity with martyrs and their families. In the lead-up to the May 9 anniversary, electronic media continue to broadcast advertisements recalling violent protests, mobs clashing with the police, attacking and entering the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi and vandalising the Lahore corps commander’s residence. PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari said May 9 will “always be remembered as a dark day in country’s history”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported. The president and the premier recalled that on May 9 last year, “a politically instigated mob ran amok across the country, damaging public property and military installations”. In his statement issued last night, President Zardari condemned the violence and said that the “unfortunate incidents severely tarnished the country’s image, which only served the interest of Pakistan’s enemies”.  Terming the incident as an “attempt to challenge the writ of the state, undermine the rule of law and weaken the institutions”, the president expressed pride in Pakistan’s armed forces and institutions. He emphasised that those responsible for the May 9 violence should be held accountable according to law. President Zardari affirmed that any attempt to misuse the right to peaceful demonstrations to incite violence would never be tolerated. However, he stressed that the “current political situation demands that all political parties work towards promoting tolerance, democratic values, and political dialogue, and provide a clear direction to the nation”. On the other hand, the PTI, which has been at the receiving end of a crackdown after the riots, has planned to organise gatherings across the country to express solidarity with its incarcerated leader ex-PM Imran Khan. In order to counter the PTI’s protests, authorities in Islamabad and Punjab have already imposed Section 144.  According to the PTI, over 10,000 of its workers were arrested, but the government claimed it arrested only a few thousand people. The PTI not only challenged the military court cases in the Supreme Court but also alleged that the riots were a false-flag operation designed and carried out by the establishment to dismantle the former ruling party. People belonging to different walks of life were visiting Lahore’s Jinnah House on the eve of the first anniversary of May 9 riots, Radio Pakistan reported on Wednesday. A delegation of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) and the Punjab Union of Journalists who had visited Jinnah House condemned the desecration of martyrs’ memorials. They expressed anger over the burning and siege of Jinnah House, adding that there was “no place for such political extremists in Pakistan”, the state broadcaster reported. A group of Peoples Democratic Alliance and Lawyers also paid a visit to Jinnah House, regretting that despite the passage of one year, the perpetrators of May 9 have not been brought to justice, it said.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832432/real-aim-of-may-9-riots-was-to-end-democracy-in-pakistan-pm-shehbaz

24,PSO proposes swapping debt for stake in public sector companies,"Pakistan State Oil (PSO) said it is in talks with the government on a plan to acquire stakes in public sector energy companies and offset mounting debt it is owed by firms such as the national airline. Stopping the pile-up of unresolved debt across the country’s power sector, and ultimately settling it, is a top concern of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with which the government will begin talks this month for a new long-term loan deal. “Everything will be done through competitive bidding and we will participate and if we win, the stakes will be offset against (PSO’s receivables),” said Syed Muhammad Taha, the managing director and chief executive of the state-backed oil marketer. “That is our proposal and this is under consideration, so we are working with the government,” Taha said in an interview on Wednesday with Reuters. The government, with a stake of about 25 per cent, is the biggest shareholder of PSO, but private shareholders own the rest. Government officials, including the petroleum and information ministers, did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.  According to the IMF, the total circular debt in Pakistan’s power and gas sectors stood at Rs4.6 trillion, or about 5pc of GDP by June 2023. Circular debt is a form of public debt that stems partly from failure to pay dues along the power sector chain, starting with consumers and moving to distribution companies, which owe power plants, which then have to pay fuel supplier PSO. The government is either the biggest shareholder or the outright owner of most of these companies, making it tough to resolve debt as fiscal tightening leaves it strapped for cash. Among other steps sought by the IMF, the government has raised energy prices to stop the buildup of debt. But the accumulated amount still has to be resolved. Taha said the IMF reforms helped the sector by boosting creditors’ ability to pay, which will continue to improve. PSO’s aggregate receivables from government agencies and autonomous bodies stood at Rs499bn, the largest share owed by gas provider Sui Northern Gas, whose largest shareholder is the government. PSO’s annual report last year said the crisis of owed debt was a serious issue for it. Taha said PSO had initially floated the idea of acquiring stakes or complete ownership of assets such as power plants in Nandipur in the northern Punjab province and Guddu in southern Sindh, as well as the government-owned holding entity for power generation companies. It also discussed equity stakes in profitable public sector companies such as the Oil and Gas Development Co (OGDC), he added. Taha said PSO was also a part of the broader settlement framework to privatise Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which would potentially include a “clean asset swap” and a stake in the airline’s non-core assets, such as property. The government is putting a stake ranging from 51pc to 100pc in the debt-ridden carrier as part of the public-sector reforms sought by the IMF. In March, media said the principal alone that PIA owed PSO for fuel supply amounted to roughly Rs15.8bn. Taha added that he expected modest growth in demand for petroleum products as the economy opens up, thanks to lower interest rates and higher disposable income. As economic conditions improve, he added, PSO is working with big strategic investors from China and the Middle East to upgrade and expand Pakistan Refinery. PSO has a network of 3,528 retail outlets in addition to 19 depots, 14 airport refuelling facilities, operations at two seaports and the largest storage capacity of 1.14m tonnes.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832452/pso-proposes-swapping-debt-for-stake-in-public-sector-companies
25,Imran refuses to tender apology over May 9 riots,"• Says ready to face inquiry into 2014 dharna
• Alvi says those having ‘real power’ should initiate dialogue ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday refused to apologise for the May 9 riots and said he is ready to face inquiry into the sit-in that his PTI staged in 2014. He was speaking to the media after the court proceedings in the £190 million corruption case at Adiala jail. When asked whether he would apologise for the May 9 violent protest, Mr Khan replied in the negative, saying he was under detention at the time and was unaware of those protests. The ex-premier mentioned that he became aware of the protests when he appeared before the then-chief justice of Pakistan, Umar Ata Bandial. “I had already condemned those violent protests,” he added. It may be mentioned that a day earlier, the director general of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) ruled out dialogue with PTI unless the party leadership tendered a public apology over the May 9 protests. Mr Khan further said that if the establishment is not interested in dialogue, PTI will not pursue it either.  According to the former premier, he wanted dialogue for the sake of Pakistan, not to strike a deal for personal favours. However, he clarified that he has no issue with the army as his close relatives are serving in the armed forces and bureaucracy. Mr Khan expressed readiness to face inquiry into the 2014 sit-in and stated that he would gladly appear before the inquiry committee. He further said that the allegations levelled against him in connection with the 2014 sit-in had proved to be wrong. Mr Khan stated that the sit-in was staged to protest the 2013 elections, adding that the 2024 elections are also fraudulent, as the former caretaker prime minister has also disclosed information about Form-47. He claimed that some PML-N leaders had privately conveyed to PTI that elections would not be held until Justice Qazi Faez Isa became the chief justice. During the court proceedings, accountability judge Nasir Javed Rana recorded the statement of a witness, while the counsel for Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi cross-examined another witness. The court accepted Mr Khan’s application for his medical check-up and adjourned the proceedings till May 13. Impartial inquiry In Lahore, former president Dr Arif Alvi while speaking to the media outside the Punjab Assembly emphasised the need for an impartial investigation into the events of May 9 and urged that the perpetrators be brought to justice. He said, “The oppressor should seek forgiveness. Forgiveness is the only answer to all disputes.” He said those who did not know the meaning of democracy were preaching democracy. He said the evidence, if any, of the May 9 riots should be presented before courts. “When I was president, [Imran] Khan sahib called for a dialogue,” he added. He mentioned that Mr Khan always voiced for a peaceful protest and resolution of all disputes through dialogue. In an obvious reference to the establishment, Dr Alvi said those having real power should initiate the dialogue process. He said the present government was artificial and completion of its tenure was unlikely. The former president said he visited the assembly to meet the opposition members. He said it was unfortunate how the parliament was filled with those who won the elections with the help of Form-47. He said that judges should be appointed purely on merit and the freedom of media was critical for the democracy in the country. “We are Pakistani and all institutions including the army belong to us,” he said.

26,Economic crisis deepens amid political instability,"KARACHI: Industrialists and analysts express growing concerns as political protests and wheat farmer demonstrations escalate, casting shadows over business activities and economic stability. The business community, already beset by high inflation and interest rates, feels that political issues overshadow economic priorities. “A rising tide of unrest and protests against the government has cornered the economy, making it difficult for businesses to operate effectively,” one businessman stated anonymously, reflecting the prevalent fear of backlash for speaking out. Some traders and industrialists note that persistent political disturbances have dashed hopes for stability after visible economic improvements compared to last year. Industrialists, analysts lament govt yet to develop long-term growth strategy “There is no sign of stability in the government, which reflects rising vulnerability in the economy,” said Aamir Aziz, an exporter. “Daily remarks from the Supreme Court and high courts on political and corruption issues leave us in limbo, particularly concerning our future strategies,” Mr Aziz said. He emphasised the need for a well-defined economic and political roadmap to attract investment. A Karachi-based head of research noted that trade and industry were not clear about the economy’s future, and the present government has yet to develop a long-term growth strategy. He lamented that economic growth, which must be the government’s priority, has been put under the shadow of inflation and interest rates. He said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has also failed to spur growth or bring down inflation and appears to be overwhelmed by the challenge. The private sector is working with least participation, which will bring down the growth rate to even lower than two per cent this year. “Despite sovereign default, Sri Lanka recovered within two to three years and the current inflation is 7.5 per cent. This is not a miracle but management,” he said. Some bankers believe that the SBP is managing the exchange rate, and this stability may vanish in one go. Amid these economic challenges, analysts also noted some positives, such as Saudi investors’ interest in major Pakistani assets, which could temporarily bolster the country’s external accounts. However, the looming need for $25 billion for debt servicing next fiscal year and a persistent trade deficit threaten to offset these gains. “The stable exchange rate is not the benchmark for the economy’s growth. It is only a sign that the country can pay back the dues and be able to trade with any country,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market. He noted that the current account deficit has significantly decreased, yet the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves are largely borrowed, showing no clear policy on managing external and domestic debts.

27,"Pakistan, Uzbekistan vow early work on rail project","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Uzbekis­tan on Wednesday underscored their commitment to the swift completion of the planned railway link that will traverse Afghanistan, connecting the two countries and promising to enhance regional connectivity and trade opportunities. Foreign Office, in a media sta­tement after a meeting between visiting Foreign Minister of Uzb­e­kistan Bakhtiyor Saidov and Deputy Prime Minister and Fo­­reign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar said, “The two sides reaffirmed commitment to early implementation of the Uzbekistan-Afghan­istan-Pakistan Railways project, which would give boost to bilateral and regional trade and become a bridge between South and Central Asia.” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in his meeting with FM Saidov also emphasised the importance of the railway project and Pakistan’s commitment to its early completion. Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan had in February 2021 agreed to build a railway line across Afghanistan to connect Central Asia with Pakistani ports at an estimated cost of $4.8bn. In July last year, the three countries signed a protocol during their meeting in Pakistan that delineated the route of the project running from Termiz, Uzbe­kistan, Afgh­anistan’s Mazar-i-Sharif and Logar provinces, and culminating in Pakis­tan via the Kharlachi border crossing in the Kurram district. Uzbek FM Bakhtiyor meets PM Shehbaz, FM Dar The railway project, spanning 760kms, is scheduled for completion by the end of 2027, with the capability to transport up to 15 million tonnes of goods annually by 2030. This rail link will notably decrease cargo delivery time between Uzbekistan and Pakistan by around five days, while also slashing transportation costs by at least 40 per cent. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, according to PMO, expressed Pakistan’s commitment to working with Uzbekistan to speed up and complete all bilateral trade and connectivity projects. He reaffirmed Pakis­tan’s readiness to provide access to Uzbekistan to Pakistani ports. At the bilateral meeting, the two sides discussed at length bil­ateral economic cooperation, tra­de, investment and connectivity. They noted that following operationalisation of Transit Trade Agreement, bilateral trade has increased 1.4 times during the previous year and has the potential to reach the targets set during the last Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) held in Tashkent in February 2023. Both sides agreed to identify new areas of economic cooperation and emphasised the importance of a liberal visa regime especially for the business community to promote linkages and people-to-people contacts, the FO said.

28,Combating terrorism is a ‘shared interest’ with Pakistan: US,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Wednesday emphasised its ‘shared interest’ with Pakistan in addressing the critical threat that terrorism poses to the entire region. At the State Department’s daily news briefing, Spokesperson Matthew Miller also focused on the treatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and urged Islamabad not to repatriate them due to the dire situation in Afghanistan. “We remain committed to working with Pakistan to address the shared threat posed by terrorist groups throughout the region,” said Miller, commenting on a recent ISPR statement about the involvement of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in a series of terrorist attacks in the country. Pakistan has suffered greatly at the hands of terrorists, and “we regret the loss of life and injuries sustained and offer our heart-felt condolences to those affected by these attacks”, he added. Underlining the need to protect Afghans forced to seek refuge in neighbouring states, he emphasised: “We will continue to encourage Afghanistan’s neighbours, including Pakistan, to respect the non-return advisory, given the dire situation in Afghanistan.” Miller refrained from taking a stance on speculations that former prime minister Imran Khan would be released soon, stating: “We do not take position on those matters. Those matters are for the government of Pakistan to decide.” In his briefing on Tuesday, the spokesperson welcomed diplomatic engagement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, applauding Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s expected visit to Islamabad later this month. Asked to comment on the Saudi prince’s visit, Matthew Miller said: “Certainly, we always support diplomatic engagement between our partners,” adding that he did not have further details about the visit.

29,Opposition leaders slam military involvement in politics,"• Omar Ayub questions who has given DG ISPR right to negotiate
• Mahmood Achakzai insists each institution should stay within its limits
• Hamid Khan says rejection of public mandate led to creation of Bangladesh ISLAMABAD: Prominent opposition leaders collectively called for the full implementation of the Constitution and criticised the military’s interference in political affairs. The leaders were speaking at a seminar titled “Tahafuz-i-Aain-i-Pa­kistan: Kaise aur Kyun”, organised by the joint opposition on Wednes­day, on the eve of last year’s May 9 violent protests erupted after the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan. The seminar also came a day after the military said that those involved in the May 9 protests need to regret their acts with sincerity and shun the “politics of anarchy and hate” before any talks could be initiated with them. However, speaking at Wednes­day’s event, PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub, the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, openly rejected the press conference of the director general of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), questioning the DG’s right to negotiate on political matters. He also alleged that the DG was confused and lacked narrative. “DG ISPR, you are a protector, not the owner of the state,” Mr Ayub declared, emphasising that real power resides with the people and their elected representatives. He also called for public access to several sensitive reports, including those on the Army Public School and the Abbottabad Commission, as well as the investigation into journalist Arshad Sharif’s death. Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who presided over the seminar, said that people have started their struggle for “Haqiqi Azadi” (real freedom). He said Pakistan’s issues couldn’t be addressed unless each institution stayed within its prescribed limits. He warned that the day anyone tried to enforce martial law or amend the Constitution, the workers of the joint opposition would be on the roads. PTI leader Asad Qaiser, former speaker of the National Assembly, spoke about the severe disillusionment prevailing in the country and urged all institutions to adhere strictly to their roles to ensure peace in the country. He announced plans to conduct similar seminars in other cities to continue advocating for constitutional governance. Another PTI leader, Advocate Hamid Khan, said the Constitution of 1956 was democratic and if it had not been suspended, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) would still be part of Pakistan. The country was divided because “we did not accept their (East Pakistan’s) mandate”, he said. Advocate Khan noted that the DG ISPR said everything regarding the May 9 incident was clear. “It means that he has made a decision. Who has given him the power to make decisions?” he added. Liaqat Baloch, the deputy head of Jamaat-i-Islami, suggested that there should be no role of the establishment in politics and democracy. “No one will accept it even if someone holds a press conference in the Faisal Mosque (saying there is no role of establishment in politics). We will accept the result of the elections, which will be held without the establishment’s interference,” he said. Allama Raja Nasir Abbas Jaffari, the head of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen, said that steps against the Constitu­tion should be stopped and those who won through “bogus” Forms-47 should not sit in the parliament. Leader of the Opposition in Senate Shibli Faraz said the Constitution should be followed in letter and spirit. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said the Constitution was practically suspended and suggested making government with the vote and support of the people. Advocate Sardar Latif Khosa said that the state consisted of only people and others were employees. “You are employees; you are not even an institution. Everyone must follow the Constitution, even if they are the chief justice or army chief,” he added.

30,May 9 fallout,"A YEAR since the events of May 9, 2023, very little appears to have changed, at least from the political perspective. In fact, there seems to be even more bad blood between the PTI and the security establishment; both sides appear unwilling to reconsider the combative stance they have taken towards each other. In a press conference on Tuesday, the military’s spokesperson made it clear there would be no moving forward without a sincere apology from the PTI and a public disavowal of “the politics of anarchy and hate”. In response, the PTI denounced the statement as a “pack of lies” that was “full of contradictions”.  It cannot be denied that the violence directed at military symbols and installations in several parts of the country on this day last year, was a direct consequence of the narrative built by the PTI following its ouster. The party had spent months framing the possibility of its chief’s arrest as a ‘red line’, all the while blaming and shaming the security establishment for its ouster from government in April 2022. This combustible mix, triggered by the controversial arrest of Imran Khan by Rangers personnel from the premises of the Islamabad High Court, exploded in the form of unprecedented, widespread violence by PTI supporters. The PTI should acknowledge that it acted in an extremely irresponsible manner by leading its supporters towards such an unacceptable reaction. Thousands were targeted in reprisals by the state, and the events of the day accelerated the expansion of unelected forces’ influence in the state’s legislative and administrative apparatus.  However, the state, too, is not without blame. Rather than acting with restraint and demonstrating that it was only interested in getting justice for the wrong that it had been caused, it responded with extreme measures that seemed to have been taken from the playbooks of past dictatorships. For example, in seeking ‘justice’ for PTI supporters’ defacement of various installations, the homes of countless civilian suspects were raided and vandalised and their residents allegedly harassed by personnel representing the state. Even women prisoners, who otherwise enjoy special protections and concessions under Pakistan’s legal system, were repeatedly denied their right to bail and kept incarcerated without trial in scores of dubious cases. The PTI-military stand-off has been the root cause of Pakistan’s political instability. Since neither side seems interested in a resolution, perhaps the government should step in. It can offer its best resources to prosecute the May 9 cases in civilian courts, thereby ensuring a transparent judicial process. Done fairly, this will prevent the two sides from engaging directly with each other, which only seems to be perpetuating the tensions between them. It is important that this chapter be closed satisfactorily so that the nation can move forward. Published in Dawn, May 9th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832365/may-9-fallout
31,The net metering dead end,"LET’S start with putting a couple of undue misapprehensions to rest. I have had the opportunity of interacting with key decision-makers in the power bureaucracy and they assure me of two things. First, solar panels installed in people’s homes are not going to be taxed. Second, the net metering rate at which power utilities buy electricity back from consumers is not going to be revised downward for those who already have their system up and running. They emphasise that changes are being considered in the net metering regulations of 2015, with a view to reducing the amount people receive for the power their systems pump into the grid, but that those with existing systems will not be impacted. Let’s hope they will keep their word, because breaking covenants is becoming far too routine for the government of Pakistan. Assuming that they will keep their word with existing customers, there is another problem of a more general but critical nature. The government of Pakistan seems to no longer be able to afford the solar revolution sweeping across the world. This is somewhat striking, since the whole idea of the renewable revolution is to make electricity more affordable and cleaner and many countries have set targets for themselves on how much of their power should come from renewable sources like solar. For example, in 2010, the world’s total installed solar power generation capacity was less than 42GW, according to Our World in Data. By 2022, this had risen to 1,053GW. This is one of the fastest rates of growth for a new power source. What is even more striking than these two data points is the slope of the graph along the way, which shows continuous acceleration year after year. Rooftop solar has dominated this growth, although some estimates are suggesting that utility-scale solar may start to overtake rooftop in a few years in some critical regions, like the European Union. But these trends apart, rooftop solar has dominated the rise, and for most countries, it has been the main driving force in their solar expansion and plans to meet net zero targets. Power bureaucracies need to adapt to, facilitate and spur on the solar revolution. Here in Pakistan, something has happened that others have experienced too, but they found innovative solutions rather than trying to suppress the growth of rooftop solar. Pakistan had targeted 1,920MW of rooftop solar capacity by the year 2026, according to its latest Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan. In reality, we crossed that threshold in 2023, if not sooner. Now they want to apply the brakes, because, according to the power bureaucracy, this rapid growth in rooftop solar is creating costs that have to be passed on to poorer segments of the population, who don’t have the luxury (yet) to go the rooftop solar route because they have single-phase meters and the technology does not yet work with that. Additionally, they have very limited rooftop space they can use for the purpose. The big problem in Pakistan’s power bureaucracy now is that the state insists on setting the price of electricity manually, using outmoded formulae. In large-scale thermal power plants, for example, they still use what is called ‘cost plus’ pricing, where the regulator actually looks at each cost item in the prospective power plant and decides what their total costs are and how much margin they should be allowed. This is partly because nobody is willing to invest in Pakistan on a large scale if their returns are not guaranteed. And the big reason for that is the government of Pakistan has a lousy reputation when it comes to delivering on its commitments. Meanwhile, the way in which electricity is produced has evolved and changed rapidly from the time this ‘cost plus’ pricing formula was developed. Back then, we had a few large-scale power plants supply electricity to a single buyer — the government — which transmitted this power to various distribution companies, all state owned, who then sold it on to a list of metered customers. The solar revolution has changed all that. Now we have what is called ‘distributed generation’ or ‘point of sale consumption’, where electricity is produced in a large and growing number of locations, and often consumed then and there. Along with this shift has come a new category of consumers and producers of electricity, called ‘prosumers’ — people who produce and consume electricity themselves. The old pricing formulae are not going to work in a world of prosumers. Here is what seems to be going wrong in the power bureaucracy with this move to bring down net metering rates, and perhaps switch to what they call ‘gross metering’ for all categories, although it seems the details are still being worked out. What’s wrong with all this is that it aims to protect the bureaucracy from the disruptive impact of a new technology that is spreading rapidly around the world, and changing how power sectors are organised. Imagine, in the early 2000s, if the bureaucracy had moved to protect the Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation from the disruptive impact of mobile phones. Imagine if they made the argument that this new technology was being used by elites, who were opting out of the PTC system, leaving the rest to carry the costs of the state-owned telecom infrastructure. Imagine if the state gave in to their arguments, and moved to heavily tax handsets and talk time and priced the new technology out of the market. Where would we be today? Something similar, perhaps not identical, is happening today with solar and other renewable power generation technology. Power bureaucracies need to adapt to, facilitate and spur on this revolution and increase the speed of its adoption. The key change begins with pricing and then the ‘single buyer model’, allowing power generators to sell to their customers directly instead of through the state. Instead, they seem more concerned with protecting the financial health of their bureaucracy in the face of this revolution.

32,"Dubai, Baku and Belém","THE federal government has just initiated an important but overly cautious process of streamlining its institutional landscape dealing with climate change. The primary motivation is to stre­ngthen the ability to unlock climate finances. But would establishing the Climate Change Authority, reconstituting the Climate Change Council, or updating the Rules of Business to eliminate redundancies from the climate ministry’s mandate alone help turn around the nation’s climate vulnerabilities or access international finance? It is indeed important to delineate the roles and responsibilities of multiple players and strengthen coordination between national and provincial stakeholders. These changes, however, need to be guided by a clear roadmap of Pakistan’s climate journey. Can the process be aligned with domestic economic reforms, inclusion, and climate rights? Concurrently, can it help enhance our eligibility to avail climate finance options, which include concessional lending, trade, and investments? How can the financial flows, even if small, be accessed and made predictable to support Pakistan’s drive for resilience, rehabilitation and reconstruction after climate disasters? Global climate initiatives announced at each Conference of the Parties, particularly since the Paris Agreement in 2015, have provided ample opportunities to interested parties to engage with the presidency of each COP to take advantage of possible opportunities. Britain, Egypt and the UAE, the presidencies of the last three COPs in Glasgow, Sharm el-Sheikh and Dubai, each announced about a dozen initiatives, inviting interested parties to join in. Several of them were backed by ambitious financial mechanisms. These initiatives, pledges, and side deals are typically voluntary initiatives. They are not always managed or controlled by the secretariat of the climate change convention, and hence not necessarily part of the mandate of climate ministries. Probably half of these initiatives suited Pakistan’s development needs in such sectors as energy, agriculture, health, water, industrial production, urban planning, trade, and foreign direct investment. The ministries and departments mandated to deal with these issues are rarely, if at all, present at COPs or aware of the opportunities. Pakistan’s climate policies must be guided by scientific data and scientific research. The climate summit in Dubai, for example, made 11 pledges backed by overall commitments amounting to $85 billion. These included doubling finances for adaptation, tripling renewables, doubling energy efficiency, halting deforestation, announcing frameworks for global climate resilience, developing programmes for a just transition, and an agreement to operationalise the Loss and Damage Fund (LDF). Except for the last one, Pakistan did not show much appetite for any of the initiatives, even if Sultan Jabbar al-Jaber, the UAE COP chair, visited Pakistan prior to the COP to check Pakistan’s pulse for various initiatives and to win support for them. The initiatives announced in the UAE have set the menu for global climate action that will inform at least the next two climate summits: in Baku this November, and Belém, Brazil, in December 2025. The COP in Azerbaijan will prioritise mitigation, regional peace, and water issues. The likely focus in Brazil will be social development, climate justice, and protecting forests and local communities. The agendas of the two COPs are evidently very closely aligned with Pakistan’s development needs. These initiatives are typically linked with the country’s economic development, structural reforms under discussion with the IMF and multilateral development banks, and the transformation needed to meet SDG targets. A roadmap adopted now can help avoid the annual pangs of guilt. The agenda for Baku will review the implementation of COP28 targets, particularly to advance the Paris Agreement goals. It will strive to finalise the first enhanced transparency framework, establish a new collective quantified goal on fina­n­­ce, scale up targets for climate finance, and fina­lise the LDF. Baku will also host a series of high-level political convenings to assess barriers to NDC development, regional ‘green corridors’ for grid-scale storage, and the role of trade in accelerating climate and sustainable development actions. It would be unrealistic, indeed unfair, to expect the climate ministry to engage with and independently assess these processes, let alone lead the country to access finances from such initiatives. The global climate agenda clearly calls for reforms that go beyond amending the Climate Change Act of 2017 or integrating it with the Environmental Protection Act, 1997, in order to remove inconsistences. We also need to develop institutional mechanisms and ways to link global climate negotiations with the priorities set for domestic economic development, rather than tepid responses every year. This calls for integrating climate considerations in various ministries and departments. The foregoing can serve as the basis for a four-track climate policy: First, Pakistan’s climate policies must be guided by scientific data and scientific research. The Global Change Impact Study Centre, Zoological Survey, and Pakistan Environment Protection Agency are housed at the climate ministry. They can be mandated to specifically develop baselines and set standards for climate emissions, biodiversity, and environment. Together with the Bureau of Statistics, they can develop Pakistan’s natural resource income accounting, because the income generated from natural resources and ecosystems must be measured. We need to assess the economic value of natural resources and the impact of economic activities on the environment. Second, Pakistan’s climate priorities must be co-created with the provinces. We must avoid the risk of a competitive relationship with sub-national entities. Any differences, as well as the agenda of the Climate Council, must be cleared by the Council of Common Interests. The Climate Council must be a professional organisation and should not take over the functions of the CCI. The climate ministry should build upon its rich experience of dealing with the provinces on environmental and climate issues. Third, Pakistan’s finance minister must spearhead the drive for climate finance. Since he has greater clout than most other cabinet members, he must inform parliament on all climate finance successes and failures with the development partners and the hosts of the annual COP meetings. Fourth, Pakistan’s policy must be embedded in sectoral, national and provincial policies, public-private partnerships, and private sector investments by the Planning Commission. The latter’s historically central position must be availed to embed climate change in a whole-of-government effort to link the global climate discourse with Pakistan’s development agenda.

33,Reserved seats,"IT is usually best not to presume, but given recent developments, one may tentatively hope that the judiciary has finally woken up to the controversies surrounding the general election. Following a series of widely criticised decisions from the Election Commission of Pakistan — each of which, it seems, distorted or subverted the public mandate — the judiciary has finally checked the electoral body for exercising arbitrary control over the democratic process. A three-member bench of the Supreme Court admitted a petition this Monday against an ECP decision to give various political parties more reserved seats than they were lawfully entitled to, suspending the decision till further notice. The petition in question was moved by the Sunni Ittehad Council, which has been arguing that the ECP and Peshawar High Court’s denial of its right to a total of 78 reserved seats in various assemblies was unlawful and must, therefore, be reviewed by the apex court. From the interim order issued by the Supreme Court, it appears that the judges who heard the petition were not inclined to agree with the government and the ECP’s logic regarding why the 78 reserved seats denied to the SIC should be allotted to other parties. During proceedings, the court observed that this decision appeared to have distorted the public’s mandate. Since there was no legal precedent or clear justification for the ECP’s decision, it was agreed that the question would require a constitutional interpretation. The matter has consequently been remanded to the apex committee of the Supreme Court for the formation of a larger bench. Till the case is decided, the interim order also, in effect, scuppered any government plans to start tinkering with the Constitution thanks to the two-thirds majority it had secured in the Lower House due to the ECP’s decision. This may be for the best. One of the other big questions at the moment is what is to be made of the Senate elections held recently, in which the lawmakers who currently occupy the challenged seats also voted. In case the Supreme Court strikes down the ECP’s decision, would that mean that the Senate election could be challenged on related grounds? This could prove to be a major headache for the government, as it would further undermine its already questionable legitimacy. If such a situation comes to pass, those affected will only have the ECP to blame. The truth is that the entire process — from polls, announcement of results, formation of assemblies and elections to the Senate — has been mishandled. The electoral watchdog has been so busy finding faults in and imposing penalties on one party that it has been unable to reflect on the many disasters it has wrought in the process. It should deal with the consequences itself. Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832154
34,Most hated country in the world,"WHATEVER the Americans may have said on record, the past few weeks of the war in Gaza have proved to be quite trying for them. Central among their concerns is the hit that President Joe Biden’s re-election chances have taken as the war drags on. In the opinion polls, American voters do not actually list the war in Gaza as one of their central concerns, with the economy and abortion taking the lead. However, those that tend to complain about the economy in the US feel that the seemingly endless amount of aid flowing to Israel and Ukraine ismoney that should have been spent on improving their own situation at home. Even though the US economy is currently in the lead globally, rents and food prices at home continue to be high, causing many Americans to criticise the Biden administration’s policies. As many know, the campus protests and the fact that scores of graduation ceremonies in the US have been cancelled because protesters have vowed to disrupt them have added to the pressure, which the Biden administration has been feeling, to bring the war to an end. Even though the Democrats have stuck to their usual line of promising unconditional support to Israel and even joined the Republican-controlled House in approving $26 billion in military assistance to Israel, there has been discomfort within. Most of this comes from the internal polling done by the Biden campaign, which reveals a generational shift in the US on the issue of Israel. Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats need young voters to turn out in huge numbers if they are to win like they did in 2020. In states like Pennsylvania — a battleground state — it is precisely this group of voters that took Joe Biden to victory last time. Many of these voters were from cities like Philadelphia, which is home to many universities, and where there is an increasing feeling of reluctance to vote for Biden again, given his position on the war in Gaza. While these young people would not be lost to Trump, most would likely just stay home; and if they do, then it would be the end of Biden’s possibilities in Pennsylvania. Israel is America’s spoilt child. It is used to throwing a tantrum on the floor of the toy store if it does not get what it wants. Not too far away from Pennsylvania is Michigan, another battleground state where the Democratic Party needs large numbers of urban voters in places like Dearborn. The large Arab-Muslim population in the state is unlikely to show up for Biden if the war continues to drag on into November, and the number of Palestinian casualties continues to mount. Attempts by the Democratic Party to engage this population have not produced many positive results, with local groups showing disinterest in visits by high-ranking Democrats given their position on Israel. At the commencement ceremony for the University of Michigan, held last weekend, a huge student walkout, complete with Palestinian flags and keffiyehs, disrupted the proceedings and provided a clear statement of the shape of things to come if matters did not change soon. On one political talk show, Queen Rania of Jordan pointed out that the world simply does not understand how the US can say Israel should not bomb civilians but then continue to provide it with weapons to bomb civilians, or complain about the lack of humanitarian aid and build a pier to provide it but vote down ceasefire resolutions at the UN. It is what everyone outside the US already knows, but reiterating it to a US population reflects some level of awareness that the US will lose even more of its already flailing international reputation if the war continues. None of this promises a good or durable deal. The Israelis have been coddled by access to seemingly bottomless American coffers, and to an obstinate moral immunity for a terribly long time. Listening to the Zionist perspective often reveals their inability to understand how suddenly and decisively American public opinion has changed. Many continue to draw parallels with how Jewish students on various American campuses may ‘feel’, as well as the Holocaust. They are simply not able to see how utterly delusional their perspectives sound when considered against the more than 34,000 dead Palestinians and the horribly suffering and maimed women and children that Americans have been watching for over six months. Jewish intellectuals like the author Marsha Gessen, who compared Gaza to the ghettoes in Poland during the Holocaust, have faced derision from Zionists, but their silencing has been viewed with alarm by everyone else. Israel is America’s spoilt child. It is used to throwing a tantrum on the floor of the toy store if it does not get whatever impractical plaything or ridiculous demand it makes. It is likely to continue with its behaviour beyond an invasion of Rafah just to have the last word and pretend at some imaginary ‘victory’. There are plenty of hardliners in Israel who even imagine themselves and their country as being able to conduct wars without the assistance of the US. It is just one of the many delusions that have led Israel to where it has ended up after inflicting six months of merciless death and destruction on Palestinian civilians. Its international reputation is in the gutter, people all around the world are up in arms at its genocidal bloodlust, and now even the Americans seem uninterested in standing by their rabid child as it continues to demand a perpetual supply of Palestinian blood to satisfy its desires. Israel may be able to stall a ceasefire, and try to take the joy of peace away by insistently inflicting pain on what is left of the Gazans in Rafah. But in its pursuit of this, it will achieve nothing other than becoming the most hated country in the world.

35,Disrupting Agriculture’s Fiscal Model,"The Industrial Revolution changed the world when governments began to prioritise industries over agriculture. The process led to rapid economic growth in western Europe, North America and parts of Asia, mainly north Asia. The Industrial Revolution was run on fossil fuels and although it massively improved living standards, it led to an existential crisis in the form of carbon emissions, now totalling over 35 billion tons a year. Humanity is now at a crossroads where we have to heal the planet and, at the same time, develop a sustainable path of economic growth and a system of global governance that will develop markets in parts of the world that were left behind by the Industrial Revolution. The world needs a new and enabling form of capitalism that will rapidly bring in sustainable growth and benefit the agro markets of the developing world. Globally, there are approximately 570 million farms, and they can be largely categorised as those falling in the developed and developing (or underdeveloped) parts of the world. The agriculture sectors in the US and the EU receive massive government funding and subsidies, mainly as direct fiscal transfers to farmers. These countries have smaller populations engaged in agriculture (1.3% and four percent in the US and the EU, respectively), and their governments have ample fiscal space to support and subsidise agro producers. In developing countries, a far larger proportion of their population is engaged in agriculture (in India and Pakistan, over 40% of the respective population is engaged in agriculture, and the figure for rural labour is even higher), and governments do not have the fiscal space to provide support to the people engaged in agriculture. In fact, in much of the developing world, government policies are focused on providing cheap food, mainly by controlling food prices. The consequences of this extractive nature of macroeconomics are manifested by the rural population migrating to urban centres in search of jobs. The challenge is: how can the developing world produce enough food to feed its local population and then have enough to export to developed countries? Globally, we have the technology to gather data on every farm in the world, and in the last two decades, we have acquired two significant tech capabilities: satellite imaging and digital payment systems – they have the potential to transform rural businesses in the developing world. It is this kind of enabling capitalism that is needed in countries like Pakistan, especially in sectors where there is a lack of business and economic opportunities. A Level Playing Field for Rural Businesses
The question is, how to introduce the kind of capitalism that brought rapid development in agriculture in the developed world, and in this respect, the first reality that has to be acknowledged is that stakeholders have to agree that these countries cannot provide the kind of fiscal support richer countries can give their farming community. The best that developing countries can do is provide their farming and rural communities with a level playing field, aided by enabling capitalism. The most obvious step is to stop suppressing food prices. In most developing countries, the availability of cheap food is ensured through different means, but the bottom line remains the same. In India, the government procures food at a minimum price and it is then provided free or at subsidised rates to poorer households, effectively raising the price for the producer. In Pakistan, food prices are suppressed through administrative measures and export controls – sugar is a case in point. Instead, governments should ensure food availability by purchasing the produce at market rates and then providing it to vulnerable households in both rural and urban areas. For example, the US government supports farmers with nearly $50 billion worth of fiscal transfers and subsidies and provides $87 billion to augment the agro produce market. This is an important lesson that our economic policymakers should learn: it is possible to support food producers without suppressing the market for agro produce. Finance for Rural Businesses in the Digital Age
Finance is to business what air is to our lungs, and agricultural and rural businesses in the developing world are starved of competitive sources of finance. In countries where agriculture is massively subsidised, detailed data collection is essential to understanding issues and opportunities. It helps governments respond and support farmers in managing risks and seizing opportunities. In the EU, every farmer receiving a minimum of 200 euros per acre must apply every year, and it is this mechanism that allows governments to gain a full picture of the agricultural sector. In Pakistan, there is a dearth of reliable data for the agriculture sector, and at times, it seems that we are happy to apply faulty data to policy decisions. For example, every year, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) fixes the agro credit target to the tune of trillions of rupees (the current year’s target is Rs 2.250 trillion). However, according to Salim Raza, a former governor of the SBP, agro-lending stands at only three percent of the banking sector’s lending portfolio, while the figure in India is 19% and in Bangladesh it is 21%. So how does one motivate the banks to increase their agro-credit, especially given the sector is vital for Pakistan’s wider economy, as well as being a good market for banks? Experience has shown that banks are the last among stakeholders to extend credit to farms and livestock enterprises because of a fear of agro markets – a fear that is not restricted to Pakistan but is present across the developing world. In Pakistan, bankers fail to differentiate between their fears and legitimate business risks. The result of this mindset is that despite celebrations about ‘achieving agro-credit targets’, institutional sources of finance for farmers in Pakistan are almost non-existent. Policymakers need to look beyond bankers towards alternative sources of finance and tap into peer-to-peer lending options. Peer-to-peer lending has been prevalent in the region for a century and has now gone global, with tech platforms extending this concept on a massive scale. In 2022, Pakistan formalised peer-to-peer lending (rather, they killed it) and the government permitted a maximum limit of rupees one million to a borrower, funded by at least two investors. It was a classic case of how not to do things. As a highly regulated industry, banks need to be disrupted before they are ready to enter the rural finance market as a business opportunity, rather than being coerced by the SBP or because the government has set a target. Livestock and dairy account for over 50% of agriculture’s GDP, yet farm credit data hardly shows up on the credit assets of most bank balance sheets. The consequences of such low financing are reflected in lower farm productivity, with farmers depending on money lenders and arthis for their running finance and asset acquisition needs. Pakistan’s agricultural transformation will not be possible with the kind of mediaeval financing options available to farmers. Agriculture Infrastructure and Climate Change
Infrastructure is a major handicap throttling the transformation of Pakistan’s agriculture sector, and in this context, the irrigation network is the most important. Drainage is the other side of the irrigation coin and functionally does not exist in Pakistan, resulting in salt accumulation in the soil at the rate of one ton per acre per year. The problem is that for most world policy gurus, infrastructure largely means roads, bridges, ports and power stations, and does not include irrigation installations such as barrages and canal networks. Although no formal asset valuation of Pakistan’s irrigation system exists, (comprising three large dams, 19 barrages, 43 main canals, hundreds of branch canals and over a million water courses in the Indus Basin), its asset value must be in the hundreds of trillions of rupees. Given the government’s lack of fiscal space, these assets should be used to raise international finance, including government, private sector and hybrid finance, if Pakistan is to reduce its climate change vulnerability. Despite the rain damage in Sindh and Balochistan and the devastation caused by the 2022 floods, policy planners have done absolutely nothing and we continue to wait for calamities to strike. There is enough evidence to show that borrowing for water in the name of climate change has made matters worse. Both the Left Bank Outfall Drainage (LBOD) and Right Bank Outfall Drainage (RBOD) projects have proved worse than useless. The severity of the 2022 monsoon rains was caused by climate change (as confirmed by Imperial College’s World Weather Attribution), but the damage was exacerbated by faulty irrigation and drainage infrastructure. The Geneva Conference in January 2023 pledged more than what Pakistan requested, yet we have failed to submit quality and investment plans, while we wait for yet another rain disaster. Agro Technology
In Pakistan’s agricultural context, nothing is more important than drainage technology. Tile drainage is a Dutch invention dating to the Middle Ages and is used to control the rise of the subsurface water table caused by supplementary irrigation. In Pakistan, particularly in Sindh, where the groundwater is saline and where options to use groundwater for irrigation and lower the water table are limited, farmlands continue to suffer and efforts have to be made to develop tile drainage commercially. Any sort of meaningful commercial enterprise in irrigated areas will not be sustainable without a salt removal mechanism – in other words, drainage – and it is sad that despite borrowing billions of dollars from international lenders and investing them in public sector entities, Pakistan’s irrigation system is more vulnerable than ever. What is needed is a revamping of the irrigation and drainage technology options, along with smart policies aimed at making the agricultural sector sustainable. In this context, the private sector, mainly fertiliser companies, must enhance its capacity to respond to the needs of Pakistan’s agriculture. If necessary, they can tap concessionary international finance. Technology for Produce Processing
There is a huge need and potential for commodity and agricultural produce processing, based on modern-day financing. Here again, funding has become an almost insurmountable constraint given the lack of understanding by formal (and urban-based) financial houses in Pakistan. China has a $400 billion meat market, from which Pakistani farmers and exporters can benefit. However, the availability of the right technology and funding remains an issue. Marketing of Agro Produce
Marketing agro products is limited since Pakistan faces a hostile neighbourhood. Pakistan has no trade links with India; there is a war-like situation in Afghanistan; and border trade with Iran has almost dried up. Vietnam and Thailand have agro exports worth $53 and $38 billion respectively, due to their free trade agreements (FTA). Pakistan signed an FTA with China in 2006, but the benefits of this have yet to be seen. Pakistan’s foreign policy has to pivot to economic issues if agriculture is to become a source of foreign exchange earnings. All these issues, related to finance, technology, marketing and infrastructure, affect Pakistan’s agricultural productivity and require a thorough understanding of the needs and how to match them to opportunities arising in global markets. This is the single most important challenge. Sadly, agro investment has historically been seen through the lens of aid dollars and executed by unaccountable and agri-illiterate bureaucrats. The time has come to change this. Aijaz Nizamani is a hands-on farmer and agri entrepreneur.

36,Our sluggish disinflation,"WHAT goes up must come down. This truth also applies to economic trends, which exhibit cycles of ups and downs. However, the pace of going up and coming down depends not on gravity, but economic policies. We are now seeing the effects of higher interest rates, which are slowly taking the steam out of inflation in the consumer price index (CPI). Year-on-year inflation has come down from its peak of 38 per cent in May 2023 to 17.3pc in April 2024. How long does it take to contain high inflation and to lower it? If we take high inflation to mean anything higher than 15pc, then the current spell has been persisting for the last 22 months. The bad news is that in our inflation history, we have witnessed CPI inflation persist above 15pc, peaking at 29.3pc, for 28 months straight — from July 1973 to November 1975. Let us hope that this inflation history does not repeat itself in terms of the length of that spell. If we take high inflation to mean anything in the double digits (10pc or higher), then we have experienced a spell of high inflation that lasted for almost 46 consecutive months during 1972-1976. Another episode of inflation pertained to the global financial crisis of 2008. CPI inflation in Pakistan shot up above 10pc in January 2008. After touching a peak of 26.1pc, it started to decline, but stayed over 10pc for 18 consecutive months till June 2009. However, just after five months, inflation again crossed single digits and stayed at higher levels for almost 30 consecutive months till June 2012. These episodes of high inflation show that once inflation starts spiralling, it is not only difficult to bring it down, it also takes a long time to do so. This is one of many reasons that central banks around the world aim at maintaining price stability around a low, single-digit inflation figure. The current pace of sluggish disinflation could have been speeded up had the government shown fiscal prudence or the State Bank increased the policy rate beyond 22pc. However, the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee made the right move in not stifling the economy by killing growth altogether in FY24. Will fiscal prudence continue in the fourth quarter of FY24? Inflation is not the only malaise hurting us. With the onslaught of high inflation, our real GDP declined by 0.2pc in FY23, and is expected to grow around 2pc in FY24. This is a combination of low growth and high inflation known as stagflation. The inflation history cited here was accompanied by high growth of 6.8pc and 7.5pc in FY73 and FY74, respectively. The economic situation is much worse now, perhaps the worst in our history in terms of low growth and high inflation. This combination is playing havoc with the poverty situation. While Pakistan had commendably reduced its poverty rate between 2001 and 2018, this progress has slowed down due to macroeconomic instability, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the devastating flood of 2022, and unending political polarisation. The World Bank recently estimated the lower-middle-income poverty rate to be 40.1pc ($3.65 per day at 2017 purchasing power parity) for FY24, which is about the same as the poverty rate in 2018. This means there will be seven million more poor individuals in 2024 compared to 2018. What should be done to bring down inflation further, increase growth, and reduce poverty? Reducing inflation requires both tight monetary and fiscal policies. While the State Bank had been maintaining a tight monetary policy with historic high interest rates, fiscal policy remained lax in terms of high fiscal deficits and government borrowing from commercial banks. Unless the government achieves a surplus in its primary balance, fiscal policy will remain lax. The good news is that under the IMF’s Stand-by Arrangement, the fiscal authorities have shown some prudence, and the first three quarters of FY24 showed a GDP surplus of 1.5pc in the primary balance, while maintaining a fiscal deficit of 2.3pc of GDP. Will fiscal prudence continue in the fourth quarter of FY24? The April to June quarter traditionally shows very high government expenditures and fiscal deficits. In FY23, the fourth quarter alone added 4.1 percentage points to the fiscal deficit, which took the FY23 deficit to 7.7pc of GDP. Similar pressures are likely in the current quarter, which will cause the fiscal deficit to mount further. Will the fiscal excesses of the fourth quarter convert the cumulative primary surplus of the first three quarters to a deficit? There is still some hope that primary accounts will show a surplus, otherwise the likelihood of getting a medium-term IMF facility will be diminished. Any policy missteps will also increase the risk of the resurgence of inflation. Growth promotion requires an increase in investment, both domestic and foreign, as well as an increase in productivity. While there is a lot of talk about attracting foreign investment, there is a dearth of focus on attracting domestic investment. Promoting domestic investment requires, among other factors, lower interest rates, which can only emerge if the inflation trajectory continues to show a downward trend. Therefore, continuing with prudent macroeconomic policies will lead to lower inflation and lower interest rates, which is conducive to higher investment. Both fiscal and monetary prudence will promote domestic savings, necessary for domestic investment. The government has already engaged with the IMF to secure a new medium-term programme that will increase the likelihood of policy prudence, at least for that period. What happens in the current quarter will be crucial for the government and our economy. While we are not in an IMF programme now, the tendency has been to go on a borrowing binge. Repeating this behaviour may cost the government dearly. It must show the foreign investors it has been wooing that it is now fiscally prudent and very serious. It must also show that our policy talk will soon translate into policy walk in the coming days. This will not be easy, as the government will be under a lot of pressure to dole out money to the usual suspects (power-brokers and resource-devouring groups) in our economy this quarter.

37,Impending slaughter,"RAFAH, the last shelter for Gaza’s hapless people, is about to face the wrath of the Israeli war machine. There had long been talk of Tel Aviv unleashing murderous force on the southern town on the Egyptian border after the devastation of the rest of Gaza. But now, as peace talks involving Hamas, the Israelis, and Arab interlocutors appear to be deadlocked, the Zionist state is set to unleash another round of butchery in order to ‘finish’ Hamas. According to media reports, Israel has ordered civilians in eastern Rafah to evacuate, while Tel Aviv has apparently moved several brigades close to Rafah, which is crammed with around 1.5m people. Israel and the US have disingenuously blamed the Palestinians for the breakdown in truce talks, but it is clear that Tel Aviv was never negotiating in good faith. While Hamas wanted a long-term ceasefire, Israel insisted on a temporary truce to rescue its hostages held in Gaza, and refused to rule out the Rafah offensive. Though voices from around the world — including calls from the UN secretary-general and the EU leadership — have advised Israel not to attack Rafah, no one in Tel Aviv appears to be listening. Meanwhile, the Muslim world’s leadership has played its part by issuing a strongly worded statement following the OIC summit, held over the weekend, in Gambia. As per the Banjul Declaration, the OIC states have called upon “the countries of the world to take action to stop … the genocide committed by the Israeli occupation” in Gaza. Yet the Muslim world’s leaders have done little of substance themselves — even symbolically — to punish Israel for its monstrous crime. Regardless of the economic clout and hydrocarbon riches of many OIC members, Muslim states have not even been able to enforce a trade and energy boycott of Israel and all those that provide it with arms and funds to slaughter the Palestinians. On the other hand, states in faraway Latin America, including Bolivia and Colombia, have snapped ties with Tel Aviv over its murderous campaign. These states, as well as South Africa, have no religious or cultural ties with Palestine, yet have expressed exemplary solidarity with Gaza, while most Muslim states have limited themselves to issuing verbose statements calling for an end to the violence. Seven months into the slaughter, there are no signs of hope. In fact, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has said the Rafah invasion would be the “final nail in the coffin” for humanitarian activities in Gaza. From the looks of it, Israel will not rest until the entire Middle East is in flames. If and when that dark omen comes to pass, the self-professed guardians of the ‘international rules-based order’ will have no one to blame but themselves and their Israeli allies.

38,"Heeramandi review — is there anything beyond the glitz, glam and fairy dust?","Within the fabric of Lahore’s walled city lies a historically rich tapestry — stories of tawaifs etched in the sand, reminders of dance against the clink of chooris and renditions of various versions of womanhood. Opulence is probably the first word that comes to mind when thinking of the new Netflix show Heeramandi. Sanjay Leela Bhansali ticks all the aesthetic boxes — the show immediately reels you into a fantastical Mughal rendering of spacious mansions, intricate outfits and dreamy lighting. Past the elaborate and maximalist world-building, I found myself deeply immersed in this world and yet, I wasn’t constantly engaged. I was searching for a story that didn’t fully take flight. This could have been a story that shifted the narrative when we look back at the history of Heeramandi. Of course, creative direction deserves its due, but there were too many things that didn’t work and for an audience looking for a story, it isn’t so easy to be distracted by “oneiric”. Watching the series was meant to be a portal into the past of Heeramandi and yet, it fell short. Of course, historical fiction comes with room for liberties, creative direction, aesthetic shifts and more but at its core, the show lacks storytelling. Initially, the plot geared us for introspection into the lives of the tawaifs of Heeramandi which swerves towards a Ram-Leela-level love affair and spirals into a Devdas-style revolution. That’s not to say Bhansali didn’t do a lot right, the women of Heeramandi carry the narrative (minus our nepo baby Sharmin Segal who plays Alamzeb). Mallikajaan (Manisha Koirala) resides as the Huzoor (Madam) of Shahi Mahal — she would live and die for the women of Heeramandi. She is fierce, unforgiving and relentless; her acting carries the show. Bibojaan (played by Aditi Rao Hydari), Mallikajaan’s daughter, is a rebel passionate about revolution. Her beauty resounds on the screen and while the eyebrow lift is jarring, her character arc is one I could get behind. From her revered mujras to her late-night escapades with the revolutionaries, Bibojaan becomes the heroine of this story.  Alamzeb, also Mallikajaan’s daughter, dreams of being a poet and leaving the shackles of her destined future as a tawaif. She meets the dreamy nawab, Tajdar (Taha Shah Badussha) and falls quickly and deeply for him. Their love story is cruel, dramatic and honestly, a little bit too on-the-nose. She reads him verses laced with a forced Urdu and passion that just didn’t hit the mark. While we do have mentions of Ghalib and Niazi, in a story that was meant to centralise the women of Lahore, we don’t hear of Amrita Pritam or Ismat Chughtai whose works highlight the plight of marginalised women. Then, we have Fareedan (daughter of Rehana, who was murdered by Mallikajaan). Fareedan (Sonakshi Sinha) is ferocious, harsh and out to avenge her mother’s death, destroy Mallika and gain control of Shahi Mahal. Her growth over the episodes was expansive and cultivated into the comraderie that always makes for a happy ending. She rules the screen, her sharp eyebrows and thirst for power awaken the story. Who doesn’t love a good anti-hero? Historically, Heeramandi was a place that taught artistic prowess. Here lies a community of woman who are the bearers of art, dance and music. Here lies a community of women known as the Queens of Lahore — they are the gatekeepers of craft, revered guardians of refined manners and aim to pass down their knowledge. The women were empowered to make their own choices and it was only after the onset of the British Raj when nawab culture was overthrown that Heeramandi became a home for sex workers. It was a crux of cultural heritage, where people came to appreciate and learn the power of dance, music and poetry. “Both the hereditary and newly trained tawa’ifs strategically deployed their shared identity as skilled performers to rise in social status vis-à-vis their power dynamic with the patrons. Apart from their artistic expertise, an essential aspect of their culture was the secret ‘art of nakhra, or pretence’ that they deployed to exploit wealthy patrons.” (Oldenburg, 1990, p. 274). The courtesans were respected and played an integral role in the preservation of the arts. In some artistic circles today, there is still talk of the enrichment that was passed down from the Mughal era (through Heeramandi). And while pieces of this history are entwined in the story, the sad reality is the lack of the raw oppression of these spaces shown in Heeramandi. It almost seems to be glamourised by fairy dust where the oppression never reaches the light — the khalas and aapas and ammis of Heeramandi are decked in jewels and lavish clothes and the suffering that should have soaked the narrative is overly glamorised.  The perfection that emanates from the walls of Heeramandi is almost uncomfortable. While patrons of art, their destinies are tied to the Nawabs of Lahore. They bring the money, the jewels, the luxury. It’s a tale as old as time — women’s fates controlled by the men around them. While outwardly queens, there is a constant reminder of the misery that walks within each of their souls. The magical realism of the sets and costumes do not make up for the filmy dialogue, melodramatic poetry and lack of plot — these women have stories to tell but they seem chained to a narrative that does not want to tell it. The sounds of the ghungroo form an eerie score for the show — a Heeramandi woman adorns her ghungroo once she has had her debut as a tawaif. Bhansali highlights the sublime, yet sweeping over the human experience to make it transcendental and evocative acts as an erasure of important stories; the plight of the women of Heeramandi (their pain, their living conditions), the Muslims living in the Subcontinent (their disconnect is confusing) and the language (the poor pronunciation and lack of fluidity of dialogue). In a lot of fiction, the body is used as a metaphor for society. And Bhansali’s period drama is no different. There was room to delve into the body politics of 1940s India and comment on the lives of the tawaifs — the overarching male gaze on one hand, the ability to speak freely of sexuality on another — where does the conversation lead? There is a layered focus on desire within the story and while the tawaifs themselves have their own desires, we only see the one reflected back to us through the male gaze. During this period, the arts were deeply connected to social class and identity (the courtesans and creators on one hand and the entertained on the other) — a transactional relationship that was steeped in the fabric of society. Music and dance act as tools to create communities and the tawaifs played a large role in that — one that must not be brushed over. Music became a part of the social construction of identity at the time and yet the show doesn’t seem to aid that narrative. Maybe Bhansali wanted to create a story that appealed to a greater audience but let’s not forget that women are the backbone of every form of creation. The tawaifs and their journeys will not be forgotten, no matter the glamour used to doll it up. Every story about a woman is a story of resistance. The end of the series was beautiful and powerful and probably one of the few scenes that left an imprint on me. The closing narration: “Like birds in gilded cages, these tawaifs knew the value of freedom…But a woman’s struggle never ends” served as the perfect culmination to a series that relied so heavily upon being perfect. And while Heeramandi explored a facet of that resistance, it too remained akin to a bird in a gilded cage, never truly showing us the cost of freedom.",https://images.dawn.com/news/1192424/heeramandi-review-is-there-anything-beyond-the-glitz-glam-and-fairy-dust
39,Security guard shot outside rapper Drake’s home,"Canadian police on Tuesday were investigating a pre-dawn shooting at the home of superstar rapper Drake, whose sprawling property in a tony Toronto neighbourhood remained cordoned off. Police inspector Paul Krawczyk said a security guard at the mansion on The Bridle Path road was taken to hospital with serious injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound after suspects in a vehicle opened fire. The shooting, captured on grainy security camera footage that has not been released to the public, happened at 2:09am. The guard was standing outside the gates in front of the residence when the shooting occurred, Krawczyk told reporters. “I cannot confirm if Drake was home at the time the incident occurred, but I can tell you that we are in contact with his team and they are cooperating,” the inspector added. He said the suspects fled in the vehicle, but no descriptions were offered. Police taped off most of the area. Several small orange markers, believed to indicate locations of shell casings, could be seen scattered on the road’s edge in front of the mansion.

40,Something’s gotta give,"IT has been almost a year since May 9. In the coming days, much will be said and written about this unfortunate day, its significance and tragedy. There will also be heated discussions about the many individuals accused — imprisoned or not — and the unrepentant PTI. But as with much else, there will be little serious discussion on how to move forward in a meaningful way, because honesty is rarely possible in public discussions. And a candid discussion would focus on the relationship between the establishment and the PTI and how this impacts the country. Take the PTI first. Notwithstanding the gloomy predictions about its demise and the quick departures of its stalwarts 12 months ago, the party managed to do well in the elections despite all the odds against it. But now, it seems stuck once again in old and new challenges. Even when in power, the PTI was a noisy organisation with little discipline. In these trying times, this hasn’t changed. With limited access to Imran Khan, the party appears to be a headless chicken. And, as old rivalries are maintained in time-honoured PTI tradition, new entrants such as lawyers and the older lot of politicians are also jostling with each other.  Decision-making has become even more chaotic. Dependent on when party leaders can meet Khan and who talks to the media after meeting him, the decisions at times are the famed ‘U-turns,’ while at others it seems that the entire lot is stuck at a roundabout, unable to locate any exit. Consider the choice of KP finance minister. It seems that the chief minister-designate was able to ignore Khan’s instructions because of his personal discomfort. Or the absolute confusion about who was going to be the party’s choice to head the Public Accounts Committee. For weeks, there was no clarity on whether or not Sher Afzal Khan Marwat, a missile who lands as often on the PTI as it does on its rivals, would be the party’s choice or someone else. The issue was resolved with the party choosing Sheikh Waqas, according to Dawn, but after much drama, with little logic. Poor decision-making has been held responsible for the party’s misfortunes rather than its run-ins with the establishment. This may not matter in the long run. What is more critical is the party’s limited choices. Its popularity is now at a point where it can no longer be denied by anyone — but it comes at a cost. Keeping in mind the mood of the electorate, the PTI will lose support if it reaches an understanding with the current set-up or the establishment. (The PML-N’s diminishing support proves this.) But neither can it sustain the stand-off. The establishment faces just as difficult a choice as the PTI. Consider the dynamics in KP, where the initial euphoria is giving way to criticism; Ali Amin Gandapur especially, and the party in general, are being accused by workers of being compromised. This has been particularly true of the government’s silence in the face of the disappearance of a PTI worker in recent days. Indeed, every small ‘instance’ of compromise or inaction is being seen as a sign of betrayal — such is the level of emotion. But without developing a working relationship with the centre or the establishment, how will the party govern? For now, the party has no answers. (Similar pressures are at work in Punjab.) However, this is not just a dilemma for the PTI, but also the establishment, which historically has always engaged with popular forces after confrontation. This happened with the PPP in the 1980s and the PML-N in the noughties. Many argue it won’t be any different this time, though of course the time frame in each of the two cases has been closer to a decade. But that was when the country wasn’t in the midst of an intractable economic crisis — a principal reason why the PTI has become the force it is. Indeed, carrying the burden of an unpopular government as well as the economy is not all that easy for an establishment that has usually been able to lay claim to public support from regions such as Punjab. But this time around, there are no goodies to share to make up for sidelining a popular party; in fact, there is just bad news in the shape of taxes or higher bills. It appears, as the last one year indicates, that the only way to manage such a situation is to use repressive measures on ordinary people, politicians and mainstream and social media.  The problem, however, with an enforced quiet is that it has to be enforced — continuously. Even then, it cannot overcome the lack of legitimacy or support; which is why in the past the establishment has always opted for a ‘reset’ eventually. In other words, the establishment faces just as difficult a choice as the PTI. If nothing changes, the pendulum will continue to swing in Khan’s favour. Consider that before Khan was arrested, there was chatter about how he continued in comfort at the expense of his party and its members. But then, he was arrested and the criticism died down. Now it is worth asking what the price of easing restrictions on Khan will be. Will it be possible to control the public reaction if he is allowed out in public in the near future, even in terms of a simple court appearance? And if there is no ceasefire, how will the establishment manage public anger and expectations, especially as it prepares for the next IMF programme? That there is realisation of this explains the constant pressure for or discussion of how the political parties need to ‘talk’. Doubting Thomases find it hard to believe this stems from the charter of democracy fandom or those who want to cheer on the establishment and the PTI together. A year on, something has to give. Reason demands this, even though it has been in short supply in Pakistan for quite some time. In the process, both the PTI and the establishment will have to pay a price. The writer is a journalist.

43,The storytellers of D’land,"“The storytellers are here”, said Dazel as she swooped down on a rock near the glistening silvery lake. “Storytellers?” asked Din Din, his curiosity provoked.  “Yes, there is a band of storytellers who go around D’Land telling the most amazing stories,” replied Dazel. “Wiz Rooster told us about it. They are putting up a show at the lakeside this weekend. I can’t wait!” “Bah! What good are stories?” retorted Din Din. “Just imaginary tales to fill up our heads! Useless!” “No, they are not useless,” cried out Dazel who loved to read fiction. “Stories tell us about the world; about creatures and events of the past; they pass down morals and lessons from generation to generation.” “I agree,” joined in Delma who had just swam up to the lake bank. “Olly the octopus always tells us that stories are a great way to not just relax, but develop imagination and help us cope with our feelings.” “Well, if you guys say so,” said Din Din doubtfully. “We will all watch their performance together this Saturday night. I have got tickets for all three of us. They were being sold at the Aviary School. I bartered them for a whole sack of sunflower seeds and a basketful of berries,” said Dazel in excitement. During the week all everyone could talk about was the storytellers’ performance. “The group consists of a curious combination of creatures,” shared Derek, Din Din’s brother. “They say there is an ostrich, a peacock, nightingales and sparrows and an owl who make up their troupe.” “You are so lucky Dazel has got you tickets for their first show,” remarked Derek enviously. “The Sunday shows are sold out too.” “Don’t worry, Derek. I’ll get tickets for the next weekend,” promised Mr. D, their father. “Don’t forget to get tickets for us too,” urged Grandmamma who loved acting and enjoyed all sorts of performing arts. “Grandmamma, you can go in my place this Saturday,” offered Din Din. “I’m not very eager to go anyways.” “No, no, Din Din, you carry on with your friends. I want you to enjoy yourself,” said Grandmamma shaking her head. “We will all go together next weekend.”
So that Saturday evening, as the sun was beginning to set, Din Din found himself sitting at the lakeside with his best friend Dazel perched on his back and Delma at the water’s edge by his side. There was a large stage erected across the lake’s bank. The audience was seated in a semicircle around it. A large shroud hung on the stage. It seemed to be made of some thin animal skin. The only illumination was the pale light of the moon. Suddenly, the strains of the nightingales’ sweet song and the sparrows tweet filled the air. A flickering light could be seen behind the animal skin curtain. Maybe it was a fire or it could have been a group of fireflies. A gasp resounded in the clearing as a beautiful peacock and an ostrich gracefully walked up on the stage in perfect unison. A hoot was heard and a large owl flew down next to the peacock. “Good evening, my dears. Prepare to be entranced,” announced the owl in his husky, mysterious voice. “Once upon a time…,” began the owl in his haunting, expressive voice. As the story unfolded, the peacock and ostrich mimed the performance, while the nightingales and sparrows provided the musical strains. The tale was a sad one about two creatures who loved each other but were fated not to be together. Din Din was entranced as the words of the storyteller wove a magical web. Around him, the other creatures too were spellbound. Din Din found himself smiling and mourning with the characters as the story proceeded. The last scene was of the ostrich lying on the stage, the peacock keening over him, her glorious feathers fanning shut. Din Din felt his eyes well up with tears. So engrossed was he in the performance that he was oblivious to his surroundings. When the enclosure filled with the sound of applause, he was jolted out of his trance. “So did you enjoy the performance?” asked Dazel as the crowd began to disperse. “You were right, Dazel,” Din Din said. “I never realised that a story could touch our hearts so deeply.” “There were so many emotions: love, betrayal, sorrow, death…everything a living being experiences in their lives,” agreed Delma. “But it was rendered so beautifully. And the way the owl used his words and his voice was spectacular.” “I didn’t want the performance to end,” said Dazel. “Next weekend will be another story. The amazing thing is that they do not repeat a story for more than one weekend.” “My family is going next weekend,” said Din Din. “I wish I could go again.” “I’ve heard that performances for all the weekends of this month are sold out,” said Dazel. “How long is this troupe staying in this part of D’Land?” asked Delma. “They stay for as long as they wish. Sometimes it’s just a week, sometimes its months. I hope they like it here and can stay for months,” prayed Dazel. “So do I,” murmured Din Din. That night as Din Din walked home in the moonlight, the soulful voice of the owl, the song of the nightingales and the graceful dance of the tall birds reverberated in his mind. “How was the Storytellers story?” asked Grandmamma who was waiting up for him. “Oh Grandmamma! It was spectacular!” gushed Din Din. “I have acted in plays thanks to you but I have never been so moved. They are maestros.” Grandmamma smiled, “The performing arts have the ability to melt the most stoic of hearts.” “Will you tell me a story, Grandmamma,” said Din Din and Grandmamma smiled.

44,PAKISTAN’S MOMENT OF YOUTH,"The future of Pakistan — good or bad — will be determined by its young; most especially by those who are between 15 and 29 years of age today. This, of course, is a cliché. But it happens to be a cliché that is quite literally true. Here is why.  Pakistan’s ‘youth bulge’ is palpable. Just over two out of every three Pakistanis today are below the age of 30 and just under one in every three is between 15 and 29 years of age (our definition of youth). What the demographic momentum imbedded in this one statistic implies is that Pakistan is not just a young country, but that it is going to remain young till at least to 2050, possibly longer.  More importantly, my own research suggests that the youth of Pakistan know this and they expect being given the attention and respect this demographic reality demands. Others who have looked at the question have come to similar conclusions. But the fact of the matter is that we do not need statistics to tell us that Pakistan is a young country. You just need to look around you. Any street. Any marketplace. Advertising on your television set. Certainly, on your Twitter feed. Any political jalsa [gathering]. Any office. Even elected officials and unelected political influentials. The generational change is not on its way. It’s here. It’s set. And, most importantly, it’s here to stay. At least for, and probably for more than, the next two decades. With the majority of Pakistan’s population below the age of 30, the young will invariably influence the country’s future trajectory. However, where the youth of today take this country will depend on the choices that today’s policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make. Eos presents an excerpt from an essay by Adil Najam from the book Pakistan: Search for Stability, published by Oxford University Press…  BEING YOUNG IN PAKISTAN In 2017, the Pakistan Human Development Report produced a comprehensive profile of youth in Pakistan, including a wealth of empirical and opinion data on the young, collected from an estimated 130,000 Pakistanis. However, the key question that we, the authors of the report, were most concerned with was “what does it mean to be young in Pakistan?” Not surprisingly, no easy answers were forthcoming. Like so many other places in the world, being young in Pakistan is both exciting and frustrating. The space that the young occupy in Pakistani society is vast and full of possibilities but, in their own words, is often described as crumbling, contested and constrained on the one hand, and uneven, unfair and uncertain on the other. It is a space that is defined by high hopes, but also deep fears. As subsequent research and events have confirmed, to be young in Pakistan is to be highly agitated, and very often angry. Our research does begin pointing out some of the reasons why this is so. For example, if you were to computationally condense the over 60 million young Pakistanis aged between 15 and 29 into a statistically representative one hundred young people, you would find that just 30 of them consider themselves to be functionally literate, 29 would never have gone to school (despite all being 15 or above), only 6 would have 12 or more years of education and just 39 would be employed. More telling, however, are the structural depravations which highlight that the space ‘to be young’ is severely constrained and shrinking. Of the 100, only six would have access to a library, only seven to a sports facility, just 21 to a park. Only three would have ever been to a cinema, only three to a live music performance. Fifty-nine would say that they do not play sports, or only infrequently. One in the 100 would own a car, 12 a motorcycle, 10 a bicycle and 77 would have no means of personal mobility. Each of these depravations becomes even more acute for women, rural youth, and other marginalised groups within the young. And, yet, within this notional 100, we also found a spirit of great national pride, high aspirations, much hope, and tremendous expectations. They were eager to announce, to any who wish to ride the tiger of Pakistan’s youth, to never forget that this is a generation that demands and deserves better. They are politically excited, excitable and astute. While only 24 percent said (in 2016) that they trusted political leaders, 90 percent of young men and 55 percent of young women claimed that they would vote in the next elections. Of every 100, 48 believe that Pakistan’s future will be bright — although 36 fear it will be bleak. Most tellingly, 67 [of the 100] believe that their lives are and should be better than their parents, only 15 expect themselves to be worse-off than their parents; 89 say they feel happy; 70 say they feel safe. All of them demand the space and conditions in which they can achieve their aspirations. In short, the world of young Pakistanis is as diverse, as differentiated, and as divided as the rest of Pakistan. However, they also have greater expectations and aspirations which, if nurtured, could yield high dividends. Much more telling, however, is the palpable impatience and restlessness which, if ignored, could result in disaster. There are three things to keep in mind as we think about youth anywhere in the world, but certainly in the context of Pakistan. First, and most importantly, youth is a defining category. The reason to think of the young as a category is not just because they are so many, but because — even if they were not this many — the 15-29 year age bracket is where ‘citizenship’ matures. Second, youth is fleeting. Analytically, too, youth is a transitory and dynamic category. Because changes happen fast and furious when one is young, the definition of youth identity and what it stands for can change rapidly, even whilst within that category. Those turning 15 or 16 today can find themselves very distant from those turning 28 or 29 and will very likely not easily recognise the passions of those who would be 16 by the time they turn 28. This may well be true for other categories too but is consequential here, because the short window of this category and the rapid changes within it make notions of what “youth believe”,  “youth stand for”,  and “youth want”, or even ideas of the “youth vote”, are much more transitory and contestable than many analysts assume, and do compound the challenges of youth representation. Finally, youth — especially in Pakistan — is an extremely diverse category. At one level, any category of well over 60 million individuals cannot possibly be homogenous and would demand an investigation into its internal contradictions. But, much more than that, each of the major cleavages that exist in Pakistani society are compounded in its young: gender, class, rural-urban, wealth, technology, ethnicities, religiosity and sectarianism, and geography.  PAKISTAN AND ITS YOUNG: THREE PROPOSITIONS Building and extending on the available research, let us review three key propositions — political, societal and developmental — on how the young of Pakistan might influence the future trajectories of the country’s society and politics. These propositions are offered not as predictions or scenarios, but as choice points. Embedded within each proposition are levers of possible change — where the youth of today take this country will very much depend on the choices that policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make on each of these dimensions. Proposition 1: The young of today are defining tomorrow’s politics, but not always in ways we imagine On the face of it, the bold sounds, sights, language, and even substance of Pakistan politics today seems driven by the young. Even where mainstream political parties are still led by septuagenarians, they wrap themselves in the emblems of youth; political rallies of all parties, even religious ones, feel like high-intensity concerts; political communication is not only geared towards the young but most often crafted by them. On the one hand, this is not entirely new, nor surprising. On the other, however, there is something palpably different, as if what would have been ‘regular’ youthfulness is now on steroids. There is significant reason to believe why it is, and will remain, so. At a basic demographic level, all political actors realise how the maths works: the young are the single largest bloc of new and impressionable voters in Pakistan and there is a long-term and steady supply of them. The demography described in the Pakistan National Human Development Report suggests that every election in Pakistan between now and around 2050 will be defined by the youth vote — including, of course, by their choice to vote or not. Notwithstanding the dichotomy of young Pakistanis claiming high intent to vote and a history of not having done so in the past, the number of young entrants into the voting mix means that, mostly within two election cycles, today’s new voter would be about to — or would already have — enter(ed) a burgeoning 30-49 years middle-age category historically the most reliable and loyal voting group in Pakistan. The political logic of investing in the young voter is impeccable. But demography alone does not explain the dominance of the youth voice in Pakistani politics today. Technology seems to have played an even more defining role; a role that is likely to be as enduring. That the rise of ‘new’ (especially social) media would trigger a steep decline of the ‘old’ (particularly print) media was probably inevitable, but the ‘control’ younger political operatives now exert over social media in all political groupings is remarkable and is now driving significant parts of the political narratives in the country. Of course, certain leaders and parties have capitalised more on courting the youth vote than others and have been differently successful in it. This matters, but mostly in ways that it has always mattered. One should not expect permanence in youth loyalties, not least because it remains a dynamic and diverse category.  It remains to be seen if the current and emerging youth bulge will practically change ballot box behaviour, but conditions are certainly ripe to create the possibility. Finally, a very remarkable feature of Pakistan’s emergent political discourse is how explicit mention of youth issues is nearly absent from political narratives. This, despite the feverish pitch of the political discourse, despite the active participation of the young in this discourse, and even despite the role the young are clearly playing in shaping the narratives. A possible explanation for this anomaly could be that politically active youth in Pakistan have convinced themselves that the pathway to material benefits for themselves — particularly, for example, in the area of employment and improved living conditions — lies through the choice of political leadership rather than of policy.  Proposition 2: Give the young the ability to be young or expect a Pakistan tomorrow that is as divided as it is today The idea that we are denying the young in Pakistan the space to be young is a major finding of the Pakistan National Human Development Report. But it is a thought that first hit me like a ton of bricks in December 2014, as I visited the New Muslim College in Charsadda — just days after the horrific terrorist attack at the Army Public School (APS) in Peshawar — to hold a focus group discussion with 15-18-year-olds on what young Pakistanis were thinking. It struck me that the young men with me in the room were not much older than the students who had died at APS just a few days ago, or those who had done the horrific killing. The reality of the APS attack hung heavy in the room and I realised, as did they, that it is the young in Pakistan who have had to do much of the dying in the so-called ‘War on Terror.’ But there was also a palpably steely resolve in the room. Here is what I wrote about that encounter: “Unlike every other APS conversation I had been hearing — on television, on social media, from politicians, in drawing rooms — theirs was devoid of sloganeering. There was no sign of despair. No hollow display of anger or anguish. No camouflaging of fear with bravado. Instead, there was resolve. Very endearing. Very becoming. Very mature. A very matter-of-fact recognition that this was the reality of the Pakistan they had inherited. A reality they now have to live with…” It is then that I fully realised the perils of being young in Pakistan. “Extremists are out to indoctrinate the young. Terrorists are out to kill them. Educational institutions can neither guarantee quality education nor physical security. An emergent politics of anger uses the passions of the young as fuel for petty politicking. The result is that the space for the young to be young has shrunk — is endangered.” My research has convinced me that the best gift that Pakistan can give to its young is to return to them the ability to be young. Indeed, it may be the best gift Pakistan can give itself — a future where this ability continues to be denied cannot be good for any Pakistani. Being young is not just about being carefree, it is also about being able to explore. In the shrinking space to be able to do so, the young in Pakistan have already inherited most of the societal divides that define the country as a whole. That as many young Pakistanis consider being a Pakistani as their primary identity as consider their religion to be their primary identity, is probably reflective of society as a whole. But what was the most disturbing aspect of our research was that more than 40 percent young men and 50 percent young women disapproved of having friendly relations with someone from another religion, or even another sect; nearly three out of every four young Pakistanis (men and women) responded that they would disapprove of someone from a different religion or sect preaching their religion. The distrust that defines Pakistani society as a whole is equally prevalent amongst the young.  Just over 20 percent said they trusted politicians, only around 25 percent trust the police, just 40 percent had trust in the judiciary and less than 50 percent in the media. All of this was in 2016, and there is enough reason to believe that trust amongst the young has only eroded further since then. Such a snapshot should be read not just as what the youth of today think, but what the Pakistan of tomorrow is likely to think. The challenges of social division, societal distrust and mutual intolerance are clearly great, but solutions are available. Silly as it may sound to some, given the enormity of the challenges, the very first — and possibly most meaningful, although not always easy — step should be resolute policy in allowing the young to be young. Sports grounds are not a big investment, but they can be more meaningful than we might think. It is remarkable how parochial we have become, and simple steps to enhance mobility for the young, including the ability for travel exchange within the country to get to meet other Pakistanis who may not look like us but are equally Pakistanis, is another small but possibly impactful investment. Safe and affordable mobility (along with reliable childcare and clean bathrooms) for young women, in fact, emerges as amongst the most effective means of significantly increasing women’s participation in the workforce. Obvious as it should be by now, it is worth noting that, as we think about youth as a category for social analysis, now and into the future, the simple dichotomy of ‘young vs old’ is not only un-useful but can also be dangerous. In society, as in politics, some of the greatest and most alienating divisions that exist in Pakistan exist amongst the young themselves. The policy challenge is to find ways to reduce these divisions now before they sink deep roots and are passed on to the future, and to future generations. The goal is not empty slogans of ‘integration’, but investing in practical means for the young in Pakistan to interact with other young people in Pakistan. Across divisions of gender, class, geography, religion and rural-urban-metropolitan, the bridges that need to be built are not just of concrete but of conversation.  Proposition 3: ‘Boom or bust?’ — it’s a choice We began the 2017 Pakistan National Human Development Report with a story that is not from Pakistan. It remains valid and is worth repeating here: “On December 17, 2010, a 26-year-old fruit and vegetable vendor in a small town in Tunisia set himself on fire, following a confrontation with a municipal official about where his cart was parked. While the specifics of what led to Mohamed Bouazizi’s death are unclear, what is indisputable is his fatal self-immolation catalysed protests that toppled Tunisia’s dictator and led to a string of uprisings in the region that came to be called the Arab Spring. “The aim of mentioning this situation here is not to recount what happened in Tunis that day, or in the other countries of the Arab Spring subsequently. [Our concern is] with Pakistan’s youth. So, fast forward to Pakistan. “Can you imagine a situation, anywhere in Pakistan, where a young person feels so frustrated by unemployment, or so disheartened, un-empowered and marginalised, that he takes a measure as extreme as Bouazizi did in Tunisia? One certainly hopes not. But hope alone is not enough. It is the responsibility of the state as well as society to enable an environment for our youth where such a fate is not even imaginable. Not even in our worst nightmares.” Trying to predict whether Pakistan’s demographic youth momentum will end up being a ‘boom’ or a ‘bust’ is a fool’s errand. That Pakistan today has the largest number of young people it has ever had and that this number is set to grow over the next multiple decades, is a fact. How this fact will play out is not a matter of reading tea leaves, it is a matter of policy choice. There is the inherent potential of a ‘boom’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new young entrants into the economy can become motors of consumption, generators of ideas and innovation and harbingers of new social energy. There is also the equally inherent potential of a ‘bust’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new entrants into the economy need new employment, can feel suffocated by the lack of room to grow, and can burn with anger when existing systems they wish for are not enabled to change. Certainly not as simple as it may sound, but the final path taken does depend on the choices made by policy, by society, and by the young themselves.

45,"Only way back for PTI is if it offers earnest apology, forgoes politics of anarchy: DG ISPR","Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharif on Tuesday said that any dialogue with the PTI could happen only if it “earnestly apologises publicly in front of the nation”, promises to adopt “constructive politics” and forgoes “politics of anarchy”. The DG ISPR made the remarks in a lengthy press conference in Rawalpindi just two days before May 9 — a day that holds significant importance in the country’s political landscape as it was on this day last year when military installations came under attack following PTI founder Imran Khan’s arrest, which formed the basis of a severe state crackdown against him and his party. Key points: In the question and answer session, Gen Sharif was asked if there was a possibility of any dialogue with the PTI, to which he replied: “If some political mindset, leader or clique attacks its own army, causes rifts between the army and its people, insults the nation’s martyrs and issues threats and hatches propaganda, then there can be no dialogue with them. “There is only one way back for such political anarchists that it (PTI) asks for an earnest apology in front of the nation and promises that it will forgo politics of hate and adopt constructive [style of] politics. “In any case, such dialogue should take place between political parties. It is not appropriate for the army to be involved.” View this post on Instagram  Gen Sharif was asked about May 9 as well earlier in the session, to which he replied: “Firstly, May 9 is not just the Pakistan Army’s case but the entire country’s. “If, in any country, an attack is launched on its army, memorials of its martyrs are disrespected, its founder’s house is set on fire, hatred is created between its army and public, and if the people behind it are not brought to justice, then there is a question mark on that country’s justice system. “We believe that, to maintain trust in Pakistan’s justice system, the perpetrators of May 9 — both the perpetrators and those commanding them — must be sentenced according to the Constitution and the law. “Nothing is hidden about May 9. The public, the army and we all have irrefutable evidence. All of us saw this incident unfolding, we all saw how everyone was [brainwashed] against the army, its leadership, agencies and institutions through lies and propaganda.”  The army official said that on May 9, “some political leaders” issued orders to their supporters to selectively target military installations. “When this became public, another lie and [piece of] propaganda was created, [claiming] that this was a ‘false-flag operation’ and ‘we do not know what happened or who did it’. “For such people, it is said: ’You can fool all the people some of the time, some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. “The question is: has this happened for the first time in the world? Incidents of a lesser degree have occurred in the past; so what do other countries do? “In August 2011, London riots took place, and after that the criminal court system came into action. They even punished children under the age of 18. “In the Capitol Hill riots […], there was no judicial commission. The people were identified and sentenced strictly. On June 27, 2023, the Paris riots happened and their judicial system immediately came into action. “I have given the examples that our elite does not get tired of quoting. [The punishments were given] so that such an incident was not repeated, so that such cliques, with incitement and specific political and poisonous aims, do not get the chance to attack the state whenever they want.” View this post on Instagram  Regarding the PTI’s demand that a judicial commission be created to ascertain the facts of the May 9 riots, the DG ISPR said: “Fine, we are ready, make a judicial commission but if you have to, then go to the root of this entire incident. “The judicial commission should also determine the goals of the 2014 dharna (sit-in) and [investigate] how the Parliament was attacked. It should also look into the PTV attack [to see] how people were encouraged to stand against the state, indulge in civil disobedience and burn utility bills.” The commission, the army spokesperson said, should also investigate “how Islamabad was attacked in 2016 with KP’s federal resources, and then again in 2022.” “It must also see how letters were written to the International Monetary Fund and lobbying was conducted abroad, so that Pakistan would not be given loans and fall into a state of default.” The DG ISPR said that the judicial body, if formed, should probe the source and target of the funding of such campaigns as well as those who spread hate against state institutions on social media. “If a specific political clique continues doing these things with impunity, then one day it will go against its own army,” he warned. “When it continues to lie, and you don’t speak the truth in front of its lies, then there will be deceit and propaganda of every kind.” He said the “real proud public of Pakistan” distanced itself from May 9 and refused to become a part of it. On a question regarding allegations by the PTI of airbases handed over to the United States, the DG ISPR rubbished the matter and said: “Neither are any bases in Pakistan handed over nor will be.” Responding to the press conference, PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan termed it “full of contradictions”. Questioned on the PTI’s claim on winning the majority in the general elections, DG ISPR said that only 7.5 per cent of people in the country voted for the “specific party”. “Let’s see the facts — on February 8, the turnout was 47pc, and around 65 million voters cast their vote,” he said, adding that the “specific party” accumulated 18.5m votes which was 31pc of all votes in total. He said that there were 69pc voters who did not accept the PTI narrative. “We live in a democracy so the majority did not go to this narrative,” DG ISPR said. “If we look at the total population, it is 7.5pc, so 92-93pc of the population did not stand with that narrative,” he said, adding that it could not be assumed that the 18.5m people who did vote stood with the PTI’s narrative. “The narrative has neither the numbers nor the thought behind it,” he added. “If you look at independent surveys, […] they ask which institution is the most trusted institution in the country. You can pick up any survey; which institute is number one [in the survey]? [It is the] Pakistan army,” he said. “There was a survey conducted in February where 74pc people said that they trust the army the most,” he added. The DG ISPR began the press briefing by addressing the tensions with Afghanistan and attacks mounted by terrorists from its soil into Pakistan. He said the plot that killed five Chinese engineers in an attack on a convoy in Bisham tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla on March 26 was hatched in Afghanistan. “A sad incident took place on March 26 in Bisham, where a suicide bomber targeted a car carrying Chinese engineers working on the Dasu dam, as a result of which, five Chinese citizens and a Pakistani got killed. “This suicide bombing also connects to across the border [in Afghanistan]; the planning of this terrorism [act] was done in Afghanistan. Terrorists and their facilitators were also being controlled from Afghanistan and the suicide bomber was also an Afghan [national].” View this post on Instagram  Gen Sharif said the army strongly condemned “this ugly game of terrorism” and was “taking all necessary actions to bring its facilitators to justice”. He said that in the war on terrorism, Pakistan’s soldiers, workers and law enforcement agencies were martyred in huge numbers. “Everyone knows that Pakistan tried its best for peace in the region and especially in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s role has been the most vital in promoting peace in the region. “Pakistan has been hosting Afghan refugees for a long time and has helped Afghan refugees more than other country, which the world has also recognised.” Gen Sharif said that despite all the efforts by Pakistan and despite raising the issue to the Afghan interim government on a state level, “TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) terrorists are continuously committing acts of terrorism in Pakistan”. He said that Pakistan presented “concrete evidence but no positive progress” had been seen yet. The army spokesperson said that links of recent terrorism “extend to terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan”.  He recalled that Pakistan had helped Afghanistan and that one of the pledges made by the interim government in Kabul was to not let Afghan soil be used for any terrorist acts. “There is concrete evidence that TTP terrorists are still using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan,” Gen Sharif said. “In this regard, the Foreign Office has registered 12 protests and the army chief has taken a clear stance that Pakistan has its reservations on hideouts of banned outfits [in Afghanistan]. “Pakistan will leave no stone unturned [in its effort] to eradicate terror networks and provide protection to its citizens at all costs.” He said that the purpose of the armed forces “is to establish peace in the country”. To ensure this, he said, “We will go to every extent to suppress the terrorists and their patrons and enablers.” The DG ISPR said that terrorists and their enablers “have been busy in attempting to worsen” the law and order situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. “In January 2024, BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) terrorists attacked the Mach Frontier Corps camp, which was bravely thwarted by security forces. In this attack, four personnel, including two policemen, embraced martyrdom, while 24 terrorists were sent to hell,” he recalled. On March 16, a North Waziristan checkpost was attacked, and as a result, seven soldiers, including Lt Colonel Kashif and Captain Ahmed, embraced martyrdom while six terrorists were “sent to hell”. In response, he said, Pakistan carried out counter-attacks in Afghanistan’s border areas and targeted safe havens of terrorists, in which eight terrorists were killed, who were involved in numerous terror acts in Pakistan. He said that on March 25, another soldier embraced martyrdom in a terror attack in Turbat while four terrorists were eliminated. He said that a terrorist named Habibullah s/o Khan Mohammad, who was captured in an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan’s Pishin district on April 23, admitted to committing terror acts in Pakistan. The DG ISPR said that so far in 2024 the security forces collectively conducted 13,135 small and major intelligence-based operations against terrorists and their facilitators, during which “249 terrorists were sent to hell while 396 were arrested”. “The Pakistan Army, police, intelligence agencies and other law enforcement agencies are carrying out more than 100 operations on a daily basis against terrorism.” He said that during the operations in the ongoing year by Pakistani forces, two of its officers and 60 soldiers embraced martyrdom. Regarding India, he said that the country’s top civil and army leadership was aware of “multiple threats” from India on the eastern border and that planning was underway to “divert attention from its internal violence like always”. “In the current year, there have been multiple violations of the ceasefire by India on a small scale, which include 120 incidents of speculative fire, 15 airspace violations and 59 technical air violations,” he said. “The Indian army is targeting innocent citizens in Azad Jammu and Kashmir along the Line of Control (LoC) but the Pakistan Army has given a befitting response and will continue to do so. We are ready to defend our sovereignty at all times and at all costs.” He said the world was witnessing the Indian army’s targeting of innocent civilians in occupied Kashmir, adding that it had tried to silence Kashmiris’ democratic voice through oppression. DG Sharif said that when the Indian supreme court read out the “pre-written” verdict last year upholding Article 370, it proved that India was “openly violating” the UN resolutions.  The DG ISPR said that the Indian government was involved in further international crimes which included the targeted killing of Indian-origin Sikhs.  “Indian agencies have also killed Pakistani citizens Shahid Latif and Muhammad Riaz on the directives of the Indian government,” he said, adding that there was credible evidence present of communication between Indian agents and the killings on Pakistani soil. He stated that the Foreign Office had also held a press briefing in this regard. DG Sharif noted that Pakistan had become a prominent advocate for Gazans among Muslim nations on the global stage. He added that during a meeting with the Palestinian ambassador, the army chief had called for an immediate ceasefire and vowed to continue advocating for the issue. He said that the army chief had vowed full diplomatic, moral and political support from the Pakistani people [for the Palestinians]. “We will continue speaking up for viable solutions to the Palestinian issue and their land,” he said. The DG ISPR also said that some political segments in the media consistently levelled allegations against the army and institutions, adding that when those segments yet failed to provide evidence when challenged, often responding with further allegations. “If institutions also started making allegations in response, society would fall into a vicious cycle,” he said, adding that he believed in “rationality, facts and the rights of the people”. “We believe that the truth will always prevail over lies,” he said. In response to a question regarding Article 19 of the Constitution (which talks about freedom of speech, expression and the press), the DG ISPR acknowledged that the article guaranteed freedom of expression, but emphasised that it also protected against attacks on Pakistan’s sovereignty, security and defence under the guise of freedom of expression. “The Constitution and the law of Pakistan are clear in prohibiting propaganda against the state,” he said. While answering a question of whether the ban on social media platform X could be removed, the DG ISPR said: “I think this is not the appropriate forum where this decision would be taken.” The DG ISPR spoke about the drive to repatriate illegal Afghans back to their own country. “The decision to send back foreign citizens residing in Pakistan illegally was made by the government of Pakistan in the larger benefit of the country,” he said. “There was [added] burden on the country’s economy, while the law and order situation in the country was also deteriorating. In no country in the world, illegal immigrants are allowed to roam freely. “So far, 563,639 illegal Afghan citizens have been returned to their countries, yet hundreds of thousands are still living in Pakistan.”",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832048/only-way-back-for-pti-is-if-it-offers-earnest-apology-forgoes-politics-of-anarchy-dg-ispr
46,Most hated country in the world,"WHATEVER the Americans may have said on record, the past few weeks of the war in Gaza have proved to be quite trying for them. Central among their concerns is the hit that President Joe Biden’s re-election chances have taken as the war drags on. In the opinion polls, American voters do not actually list the war in Gaza as one of their central concerns, with the economy and abortion taking the lead. However, those that tend to complain about the economy in the US feel that the seemingly endless amount of aid flowing to Israel and Ukraine ismoney that should have been spent on improving their own situation at home. Even though the US economy is currently in the lead globally, rents and food prices at home continue to be high, causing many Americans to criticise the Biden administration’s policies. As many know, the campus protests and the fact that scores of graduation ceremonies in the US have been cancelled because protesters have vowed to disrupt them have added to the pressure, which the Biden administration has been feeling, to bring the war to an end. Even though the Democrats have stuck to their usual line of promising unconditional support to Israel and even joined the Republican-controlled House in approving $26 billion in military assistance to Israel, there has been discomfort within. Most of this comes from the internal polling done by the Biden campaign, which reveals a generational shift in the US on the issue of Israel. Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats need young voters to turn out in huge numbers if they are to win like they did in 2020. In states like Pennsylvania — a battleground state — it is precisely this group of voters that took Joe Biden to victory last time. Many of these voters were from cities like Philadelphia, which is home to many universities, and where there is an increasing feeling of reluctance to vote for Biden again, given his position on the war in Gaza. While these young people would not be lost to Trump, most would likely just stay home; and if they do, then it would be the end of Biden’s possibilities in Pennsylvania. Israel is America’s spoilt child. It is used to throwing a tantrum on the floor of the toy store if it does not get what it wants. Not too far away from Pennsylvania is Michigan, another battleground state where the Democratic Party needs large numbers of urban voters in places like Dearborn. The large Arab-Muslim population in the state is unlikely to show up for Biden if the war continues to drag on into November, and the number of Palestinian casualties continues to mount. Attempts by the Democratic Party to engage this population have not produced many positive results, with local groups showing disinterest in visits by high-ranking Democrats given their position on Israel. At the commencement ceremony for the University of Michigan, held last weekend, a huge student walkout, complete with Palestinian flags and keffiyehs, disrupted the proceedings and provided a clear statement of the shape of things to come if matters did not change soon. On one political talk show, Queen Rania of Jordan pointed out that the world simply does not understand how the US can say Israel should not bomb civilians but then continue to provide it with weapons to bomb civilians, or complain about the lack of humanitarian aid and build a pier to provide it but vote down ceasefire resolutions at the UN. It is what everyone outside the US already knows, but reiterating it to a US population reflects some level of awareness that the US will lose even more of its already flailing international reputation if the war continues. None of this promises a good or durable deal. The Israelis have been coddled by access to seemingly bottomless American coffers, and to an obstinate moral immunity for a terribly long time. Listening to the Zionist perspective often reveals their inability to understand how suddenly and decisively American public opinion has changed. Many continue to draw parallels with how Jewish students on various American campuses may ‘feel’, as well as the Holocaust. They are simply not able to see how utterly delusional their perspectives sound when considered against the more than 34,000 dead Palestinians and the horribly suffering and maimed women and children that Americans have been watching for over six months. Jewish intellectuals like the author Marsha Gessen, who compared Gaza to the ghettoes in Poland during the Holocaust, have faced derision from Zionists, but their silencing has been viewed with alarm by everyone else. Israel is America’s spoilt child. It is used to throwing a tantrum on the floor of the toy store if it does not get whatever impractical plaything or ridiculous demand it makes. It is likely to continue with its behaviour beyond an invasion of Rafah just to have the last word and pretend at some imaginary ‘victory’. There are plenty of hardliners in Israel who even imagine themselves and their country as being able to conduct wars without the assistance of the US. It is just one of the many delusions that have led Israel to where it has ended up after inflicting six months of merciless death and destruction on Palestinian civilians. Its international reputation is in the gutter, people all around the world are up in arms at its genocidal bloodlust, and now even the Americans seem uninterested in standing by their rabid child as it continues to demand a perpetual supply of Palestinian blood to satisfy its desires. Israel may be able to stall a ceasefire, and try to take the joy of peace away by insistently inflicting pain on what is left of the Gazans in Rafah. But in its pursuit of this, it will achieve nothing other than becoming the most hated country in the world.

48,"US shows concern over safety of Imran, other prisoners","WASHINGTON: The US State Department on Tuesday emphasised the importance of ensuring the safety and security of all prisoners in Pakistan, including former prime minister Imran Khan. At Tuesday’s news briefing, State Depart­ment Spoke­sperson Matthew Miller acknowledged a meeting between US Ambassador Donald Blome and leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), including opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan. He said Blome met the leader of the opposition, and other senior members of the opposition to discuss a broader range of issues important to the bilateral relationship, including continuing US economic support to Islamabad. About discussions with PTI on rights and ‘fabricated’ charges against Mr Khan, Miller reiterated the US stance on political neutrality. “Our position is the same as we have stated previously, which is we take no position on elections in Pakistan,” he said. He emphasised the importance of upholding basic human rights while maintaining impartiality towards political parties. Miller addressed reports of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s reported warning to Pakistan regarding the safety of imprisoned former premier Imran Khan, affirming the US commitment to human rights. He said Senator Schumer might have coordinated with the State Department while telling the Pakistani ambassador that Mr Khan’s safety was a high priority in Washington but he was not aware of that conversation. “But obviously, we want to see safety and security of every prisoner in Pakistan or anywhere else in the world,” he said. “It’s something that every person, every detainee, every prisoner is entitled to basic human rights and protection under the law.” Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832193/us-shows-concern-over-safety-of-imran-other-prisoners
49,Saudi Crown Prince MBS expected to arrive within days to seal investment deals,"• Dar terms talks with Saudi investors’ delegation ‘elaborate’
• FM explains did not sanction wheat import as ECC head, reiterates Islamabad won’t take dictation on Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline project ISLAMABAD: Against a flurry of activities between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to boost trade ties, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is expected to arrive in Pakistan this month to conclude deals being negotiated between Islamabad and Riyadh. According to Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, dates for the visit had not been communicated to Pakistan, but media reports claimed that the visit was likely on May 10-15. “The crown prince had accepted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s invitation. The visit is on the cards, but no dates have been communicated to us as yet,” FM Dar said at a briefing on his participation in the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Saudi Arabia and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation meetings in Gambia. He explained that the initial understanding was for discussions to commence at the government level after MBS committed to invest $5 billion in Pakistan, followed by subsequent talks between business executives. Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud led a ministerial delegation to Islamabad on April 15-16. Later, FM Dar and PM Shehbaz held meetings with Saudi leadership on the sidelines of the WEF and over the past few days a delegation of Saudi businessmen led by the Saudi deputy minister for investment visited Islamabad. FM Dar said discussions with the Saudi business executives were “elaborate and the group left very impressed” with the way Pakistan was proceeding on the issue. He said large projects like Reko Diq and petrochemicals would be undertaken at the government level, but the private sector would collaborate on increasing trade volume and joint ventures. Pak-Iran gas pipeline Speaking about the long-stalled project, the foreign minister said Islamabad would decide on this issue in light of its national interest and commitments it had made. Referring to the external pressure, especially from the US, the minister said, “We can’t allow anyone to dictate to us or use the veto.” He said Pakistan expected other countries to respect its sovereignty, much like it respected theirs. At the conclusion of the Iranian president’s visit to Pakistan last month, both countries called for closer cooperation in the energy sector and the gas pipeline was mentioned as one of the projects. Both sides, however, did not say how they planned to move ahead in light of the US sanctions against Iran. Furthermore, Ishaq Dar said he would visit China on a three-day trip from May 13 to May 15 for the strategic dialogue with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. This would be the foreign minister’s first visit to Beijing after the installation of the new government. His visit is likely to be preceded by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal’s trip to China. About the current wheat crisis, Ishaq Dar clarified that during the last tenure of the PML-N government, which ended last August, he did not approve a summary for the import of wheat that had been presented to him. He was the head of the of the Economic Coordination Committee. “The relevant ministry could not satisfy me about the need for importing wheat,” he said while clarifying his decision on not approving the summary. PTI-US envoy meeting The foreign minister confirmed that the Foreign Office had facilitated a meeting between US envoy Donald Blome and Opposition Leader Omar Ayub at the request of the US embassy. This was part of a broader series of engagements that the US embassy sought with various Pakistani political figures, both from the government and opposition, in March. This was part of a broader series of engagements that the US embassy sought with various Pakistani political figures, both from the government and opposition, in March. “It was the initiative of the US envoy,” Mr Dar emphasised. The PTI was chided by its opponents for engaging with the US envoy, given its past allegations that the US conspired to oust PTI leader Imran Khan as prime minister. The party, however, clarified that the meeting was facilitated by the FO and not sought by the PTI.

50,"Dubai, Baku and Belém","THE federal government has just initiated an important but overly cautious process of streamlining its institutional landscape dealing with climate change. The primary motivation is to stre­ngthen the ability to unlock climate finances. But would establishing the Climate Change Authority, reconstituting the Climate Change Council, or updating the Rules of Business to eliminate redundancies from the climate ministry’s mandate alone help turn around the nation’s climate vulnerabilities or access international finance? It is indeed important to delineate the roles and responsibilities of multiple players and strengthen coordination between national and provincial stakeholders. These changes, however, need to be guided by a clear roadmap of Pakistan’s climate journey. Can the process be aligned with domestic economic reforms, inclusion, and climate rights? Concurrently, can it help enhance our eligibility to avail climate finance options, which include concessional lending, trade, and investments? How can the financial flows, even if small, be accessed and made predictable to support Pakistan’s drive for resilience, rehabilitation and reconstruction after climate disasters? Global climate initiatives announced at each Conference of the Parties, particularly since the Paris Agreement in 2015, have provided ample opportunities to interested parties to engage with the presidency of each COP to take advantage of possible opportunities. Britain, Egypt and the UAE, the presidencies of the last three COPs in Glasgow, Sharm el-Sheikh and Dubai, each announced about a dozen initiatives, inviting interested parties to join in. Several of them were backed by ambitious financial mechanisms. These initiatives, pledges, and side deals are typically voluntary initiatives. They are not always managed or controlled by the secretariat of the climate change convention, and hence not necessarily part of the mandate of climate ministries. Probably half of these initiatives suited Pakistan’s development needs in such sectors as energy, agriculture, health, water, industrial production, urban planning, trade, and foreign direct investment. The ministries and departments mandated to deal with these issues are rarely, if at all, present at COPs or aware of the opportunities. Pakistan’s climate policies must be guided by scientific data and scientific research. The climate summit in Dubai, for example, made 11 pledges backed by overall commitments amounting to $85 billion. These included doubling finances for adaptation, tripling renewables, doubling energy efficiency, halting deforestation, announcing frameworks for global climate resilience, developing programmes for a just transition, and an agreement to operationalise the Loss and Damage Fund (LDF). Except for the last one, Pakistan did not show much appetite for any of the initiatives, even if Sultan Jabbar al-Jaber, the UAE COP chair, visited Pakistan prior to the COP to check Pakistan’s pulse for various initiatives and to win support for them. The initiatives announced in the UAE have set the menu for global climate action that will inform at least the next two climate summits: in Baku this November, and Belém, Brazil, in December 2025. The COP in Azerbaijan will prioritise mitigation, regional peace, and water issues. The likely focus in Brazil will be social development, climate justice, and protecting forests and local communities. The agendas of the two COPs are evidently very closely aligned with Pakistan’s development needs. These initiatives are typically linked with the country’s economic development, structural reforms under discussion with the IMF and multilateral development banks, and the transformation needed to meet SDG targets. A roadmap adopted now can help avoid the annual pangs of guilt. The agenda for Baku will review the implementation of COP28 targets, particularly to advance the Paris Agreement goals. It will strive to finalise the first enhanced transparency framework, establish a new collective quantified goal on fina­n­­ce, scale up targets for climate finance, and fina­lise the LDF. Baku will also host a series of high-level political convenings to assess barriers to NDC development, regional ‘green corridors’ for grid-scale storage, and the role of trade in accelerating climate and sustainable development actions. It would be unrealistic, indeed unfair, to expect the climate ministry to engage with and independently assess these processes, let alone lead the country to access finances from such initiatives. The global climate agenda clearly calls for reforms that go beyond amending the Climate Change Act of 2017 or integrating it with the Environmental Protection Act, 1997, in order to remove inconsistences. We also need to develop institutional mechanisms and ways to link global climate negotiations with the priorities set for domestic economic development, rather than tepid responses every year. This calls for integrating climate considerations in various ministries and departments. The foregoing can serve as the basis for a four-track climate policy: First, Pakistan’s climate policies must be guided by scientific data and scientific research. The Global Change Impact Study Centre, Zoological Survey, and Pakistan Environment Protection Agency are housed at the climate ministry. They can be mandated to specifically develop baselines and set standards for climate emissions, biodiversity, and environment. Together with the Bureau of Statistics, they can develop Pakistan’s natural resource income accounting, because the income generated from natural resources and ecosystems must be measured. We need to assess the economic value of natural resources and the impact of economic activities on the environment. Second, Pakistan’s climate priorities must be co-created with the provinces. We must avoid the risk of a competitive relationship with sub-national entities. Any differences, as well as the agenda of the Climate Council, must be cleared by the Council of Common Interests. The Climate Council must be a professional organisation and should not take over the functions of the CCI. The climate ministry should build upon its rich experience of dealing with the provinces on environmental and climate issues. Third, Pakistan’s finance minister must spearhead the drive for climate finance. Since he has greater clout than most other cabinet members, he must inform parliament on all climate finance successes and failures with the development partners and the hosts of the annual COP meetings. Fourth, Pakistan’s policy must be embedded in sectoral, national and provincial policies, public-private partnerships, and private sector investments by the Planning Commission. The latter’s historically central position must be availed to embed climate change in a whole-of-government effort to link the global climate discourse with Pakistan’s development agenda.

51,The net metering dead end,"LET’S start with putting a couple of undue misapprehensions to rest. I have had the opportunity of interacting with key decision-makers in the power bureaucracy and they assure me of two things. First, solar panels installed in people’s homes are not going to be taxed. Second, the net metering rate at which power utilities buy electricity back from consumers is not going to be revised downward for those who already have their system up and running. They emphasise that changes are being considered in the net metering regulations of 2015, with a view to reducing the amount people receive for the power their systems pump into the grid, but that those with existing systems will not be impacted. Let’s hope they will keep their word, because breaking covenants is becoming far too routine for the government of Pakistan. Assuming that they will keep their word with existing customers, there is another problem of a more general but critical nature. The government of Pakistan seems to no longer be able to afford the solar revolution sweeping across the world. This is somewhat striking, since the whole idea of the renewable revolution is to make electricity more affordable and cleaner and many countries have set targets for themselves on how much of their power should come from renewable sources like solar. For example, in 2010, the world’s total installed solar power generation capacity was less than 42GW, according to Our World in Data. By 2022, this had risen to 1,053GW. This is one of the fastest rates of growth for a new power source. What is even more striking than these two data points is the slope of the graph along the way, which shows continuous acceleration year after year. Rooftop solar has dominated this growth, although some estimates are suggesting that utility-scale solar may start to overtake rooftop in a few years in some critical regions, like the European Union. But these trends apart, rooftop solar has dominated the rise, and for most countries, it has been the main driving force in their solar expansion and plans to meet net zero targets. Power bureaucracies need to adapt to, facilitate and spur on the solar revolution. Here in Pakistan, something has happened that others have experienced too, but they found innovative solutions rather than trying to suppress the growth of rooftop solar. Pakistan had targeted 1,920MW of rooftop solar capacity by the year 2026, according to its latest Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan. In reality, we crossed that threshold in 2023, if not sooner. Now they want to apply the brakes, because, according to the power bureaucracy, this rapid growth in rooftop solar is creating costs that have to be passed on to poorer segments of the population, who don’t have the luxury (yet) to go the rooftop solar route because they have single-phase meters and the technology does not yet work with that. Additionally, they have very limited rooftop space they can use for the purpose. The big problem in Pakistan’s power bureaucracy now is that the state insists on setting the price of electricity manually, using outmoded formulae. In large-scale thermal power plants, for example, they still use what is called ‘cost plus’ pricing, where the regulator actually looks at each cost item in the prospective power plant and decides what their total costs are and how much margin they should be allowed. This is partly because nobody is willing to invest in Pakistan on a large scale if their returns are not guaranteed. And the big reason for that is the government of Pakistan has a lousy reputation when it comes to delivering on its commitments. Meanwhile, the way in which electricity is produced has evolved and changed rapidly from the time this ‘cost plus’ pricing formula was developed. Back then, we had a few large-scale power plants supply electricity to a single buyer — the government — which transmitted this power to various distribution companies, all state owned, who then sold it on to a list of metered customers. The solar revolution has changed all that. Now we have what is called ‘distributed generation’ or ‘point of sale consumption’, where electricity is produced in a large and growing number of locations, and often consumed then and there. Along with this shift has come a new category of consumers and producers of electricity, called ‘prosumers’ — people who produce and consume electricity themselves. The old pricing formulae are not going to work in a world of prosumers. Here is what seems to be going wrong in the power bureaucracy with this move to bring down net metering rates, and perhaps switch to what they call ‘gross metering’ for all categories, although it seems the details are still being worked out. What’s wrong with all this is that it aims to protect the bureaucracy from the disruptive impact of a new technology that is spreading rapidly around the world, and changing how power sectors are organised. Imagine, in the early 2000s, if the bureaucracy had moved to protect the Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation from the disruptive impact of mobile phones. Imagine if they made the argument that this new technology was being used by elites, who were opting out of the PTC system, leaving the rest to carry the costs of the state-owned telecom infrastructure. Imagine if the state gave in to their arguments, and moved to heavily tax handsets and talk time and priced the new technology out of the market. Where would we be today? Something similar, perhaps not identical, is happening today with solar and other renewable power generation technology. Power bureaucracies need to adapt to, facilitate and spur on this revolution and increase the speed of its adoption. The key change begins with pricing and then the ‘single buyer model’, allowing power generators to sell to their customers directly instead of through the state. Instead, they seem more concerned with protecting the financial health of their bureaucracy in the face of this revolution.

52,Unwelcome returns,"WITH the prescience that philosophers share with out-of-office politicians, a hundred years ago, a leading Indian scholar analysed the combustible demography of India. In 1923, Dr Radhakrishnan wrote in his two-volume survey of Indian Philosophy: “India even today is mainly Hindu.” Describing the Epic Period, which spanned roughly 600 BC to 200 AD, he wrote: “The fortunes of the Hindus [however] became more and more linked with those of the non-Hindus.” Amongst these, he included Buddhists, Jains, Saivites and Vaishnavites — the sons of India’s soil. Muslims, of course, had yet to come. It is a lengthy tome to read, and even more difficult to digest. I chewed on it as a student in the 1960s, but gave up before reaching the end of the second volume. I returned to it recently to seek answers to the Hindu-Muslim experiments at religious coexistence since the arrival of Muslims in the subcontinent, and especially since PM Narendra Modi’s determination to expel them. India’s traditional hospitality is proverbial, but it does not extend to religious strangers. Over the centuries, Buddhists have quit India for gentler climes. Today, Budd­h­ism has over 520 million followers, of whom only 8m are left in India (Lord Buddha’s birthplace) to follow in his footsteps. Almost contemporary to Buddhism is Jainism, also founded in India and perfected by the 24th tirthankara, Lord Mahavira (circa 600 BC). Equally pacifist and non-confrontational, unlike Buddhism, Jainism has survived in India. There are between 4m to 5m still living there. A growing number are to be found today in Canada, Europe, and the US, where the practice of pious self-abnegation would appear to be at odds with crass materialism. In Modi’s eyes, India’s problem is a surfeit of 200m Muslims. In PM Modi’s eyes, the problem in India is not a majority of Hindus, but a fertile surfeit of 200m Muslims (now 15 per cent of its population). Modi’s predicament is not a question of putting a genie back into the bottle. His conundrum is how to remove the green genie from the saffron bottle. Under PM Nehru, Muslims in India rarely felt that they had to choose between their country and their religion. Under his daughter, PM Indira Gandhi, a test of sorts for Indian Muslims came in 1971, when, after her victory in East Pakistan, she is said to have commented: “A thousand years of subjugation have been avenged.” Incidentally, all of the rulers of the Mug­hal dynasty (whom PM Modi regards with anathema) — except for its founder Babar and his son Humayun — from Akbar to Ba­­hadur Shah Zafar, were born in India. They saw themselves as Indians by birth. Today, they are tarnished as Muslim foreigners. During the recent elections in Bangladesh, which brought Sheikh Hasina Wajed back to power, India did not figure as a material issue. Neither in Pakistan, where Nawaz Sharif’s earlier bonhomie with PM Modi did not affect the return of his PML-N to power. In India, though, PM Modi’s recent spe­eches during his election campaign could have been dismissed as hustings hype, were it not for their implications for Muslims within India, and for Pakistan and, by extension, other neighbouring countries. On home ground in Gujarat, Mr Modi ad­­dressed four different rallies where he ac­­c­u­sed the Congress party as harbouring a “da­­ngerous mentality”, its manifesto being in the “language of the Muslim League”. In 2017, he had accused form­­er PM Manmo­han Singh of “holding a secret mee­­ting with Pak­istani diplom­a­­ts to conspire agai­nst him”. Now his theme is that Pakistan’s political leaders “are praying for a Congress victory. Pakistan is now eager to make the prince of the Congress the prime minister of India”. To an audience in Junagadh, he add­ed: “If Sar­d­­ar Patel was not pre­­sent [in 1948], Junagadh would have gone to Pak­is­tan. The Con­g­­­ress will create a dangerous situation for the country if it comes to power. They may give away the Kutch desert claiming no one lives there.” On June 4, everyone in the subcontinent will know who will rule India for the next five years. Mr Modi knows it will be him. The Sharifs in Pakistan hope so too. They should anticipate, however, that Mr Modi as an emboldened three-time prime minister may taunt Pakistan by testing the fragile frontier between occupied Kashmir (India’s new ‘union state’) and Pakistan’s foundling counterpart Azad Jammu & Kashmir. He may also decide to withdraw from the Indus Waters Treaty, which covers the rivers flowing from the upper riparian, to leave Pakistan frothing at the mouth, knowing that an enfeebled World Bank would prefer not to arbitrate. Over the next five years, PM Modi could pressurise Indian Muslims to crowd Pakistan’s eastern borders in Punjab and Sindh as refugees. It happened in 1971, when up to 10m refugees from East Pakistan crossed into India. PM Modi may be tempted to return the compliment.

53,Grapes of wrath,"HOW I would like to live in the dream world of the neoliberal economist, in which markets are left to determine the exchange rate, where prices of wheat are left to market forces, where consumers are indifferent to eating imported or domestically produced wheat, and inputs like fertilisers are freely available at market prices, free of the monopolies and hoarding that artificially raise prices. The thoughts of a small farmer? But the harsh world that confronts us in the Punjab countryside today is very different. For the poor small farmers, who form the vast majority of the province’s nearly 5.5 million rural households with holdings of 12 acres or less, or for small tenant farmers, it is becoming clearer by the day that the government has no intention of purchasing wheat at the announced support price of Rs3,900 per 40 kilograms. For the poor farmer, hope is all but lost as inclement weather brings rain and thunderstorms, and his wife curses him for not having sold his harvest (which now lies in the open) at Rs2,700 — the going market price, which is even less than the current world price. But at this rate, he would make a big loss, he pleads. Yet no one is there to listen. Unbeknownst to the farmer, who was basking in the hope that his bumper crop would finally yield good returns and a livable income, plans were afoot to undercut the price announced by the government before the harvest. Knowing full well that a bumper crop was expected, the interim government still allowed the import of nearly 3m tonnes of wheat, costing the country over a billion dollars in precious foreign exchange at world prices that were one-third lower than the announced price. Rather than face the problem, the new government that took office in late February decided to ignore it. The ECC produced a half-baked plan in which the Punjab government deliberately played no part. For the poor farmer, hope is all but lost. In contrast to the simple, idealistic world of the neoliberal, there is a large body of literature tracing the history of how wheat prices should be determined by the government. The resulting system had serious mismanagement and corruption flaws as well as an unaffordable government subsidy. But on one point it was very clear: the farmer cannot be left to the mercy of the market and middlemen, who will fleece him in the process. If we let wheat prices be dictated by global market prices, as postulated by neoliberals, such a policy would need to be carefully thought through, especially keeping in mind the wide price fluctuations, in the context of both food security and protecting small farmers from steep price declines. This is the crux of the matter. Last year, the world price of wheat, given the market-determined exchange rate, was higher than that announced by the government. In the Ishaq Dar years, at a highly overvalued exchange rate, the world wheat price was lower. So, before we postulate that domestic wheat prices should follow world prices, we must establish if the exchange rate at which this is determined reflects its real price. Indeed, ever since the 1950s, the Pakistani farmer has paid a huge tribute to finance growth of the economy, especially industry, because agricultural prices have been kept low through overvalued exchange rates and high protection to industry to foster its growth, which changed the terms of trade against agriculture and in favour of an inefficient, uncompetitive industrial sector. And we want to continue this practice? Now, having acted thoughtlessly to allow prices to be determined by market forces and allowing large imports at world prices, what op­­tions does the government have to overcome the current wheat crisis? First and foremost, to provide some relief to far­mers who are still holding on to their harvested whe­at, the government should start procuring, on a war footing, at least 3.5m ton­nes of wheat at Rs3,900 — the price to which it has committed — and quickly rent space to store the crop. Second, the State Bank must urgently come up with a plan for financial support from commercial banks to advance loans to small famers at lower-than-market interest rates, so that they can purchase the necessary inputs to prepare and plant their next crop. Third and most importantly, the government must set in motion a well-thought-out plan for ensuring a better and more efficient system of wheat procurement. Such a plan should ensure food security and a fair return to farmers, while gradually re-ducing the role of and cost to the government in fixing minimum support prices, replacing this with a role it can afford to maintain. For now, let the government make amends for its procrastination and bring some relief to anxious farmers.

54,Our sluggish disinflation,"WHAT goes up must come down. This truth also applies to economic trends, which exhibit cycles of ups and downs. However, the pace of going up and coming down depends not on gravity, but economic policies. We are now seeing the effects of higher interest rates, which are slowly taking the steam out of inflation in the consumer price index (CPI). Year-on-year inflation has come down from its peak of 38 per cent in May 2023 to 17.3pc in April 2024. How long does it take to contain high inflation and to lower it? If we take high inflation to mean anything higher than 15pc, then the current spell has been persisting for the last 22 months. The bad news is that in our inflation history, we have witnessed CPI inflation persist above 15pc, peaking at 29.3pc, for 28 months straight — from July 1973 to November 1975. Let us hope that this inflation history does not repeat itself in terms of the length of that spell. If we take high inflation to mean anything in the double digits (10pc or higher), then we have experienced a spell of high inflation that lasted for almost 46 consecutive months during 1972-1976. Another episode of inflation pertained to the global financial crisis of 2008. CPI inflation in Pakistan shot up above 10pc in January 2008. After touching a peak of 26.1pc, it started to decline, but stayed over 10pc for 18 consecutive months till June 2009. However, just after five months, inflation again crossed single digits and stayed at higher levels for almost 30 consecutive months till June 2012. These episodes of high inflation show that once inflation starts spiralling, it is not only difficult to bring it down, it also takes a long time to do so. This is one of many reasons that central banks around the world aim at maintaining price stability around a low, single-digit inflation figure. The current pace of sluggish disinflation could have been speeded up had the government shown fiscal prudence or the State Bank increased the policy rate beyond 22pc. However, the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee made the right move in not stifling the economy by killing growth altogether in FY24. Will fiscal prudence continue in the fourth quarter of FY24? Inflation is not the only malaise hurting us. With the onslaught of high inflation, our real GDP declined by 0.2pc in FY23, and is expected to grow around 2pc in FY24. This is a combination of low growth and high inflation known as stagflation. The inflation history cited here was accompanied by high growth of 6.8pc and 7.5pc in FY73 and FY74, respectively. The economic situation is much worse now, perhaps the worst in our history in terms of low growth and high inflation. This combination is playing havoc with the poverty situation. While Pakistan had commendably reduced its poverty rate between 2001 and 2018, this progress has slowed down due to macroeconomic instability, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the devastating flood of 2022, and unending political polarisation. The World Bank recently estimated the lower-middle-income poverty rate to be 40.1pc ($3.65 per day at 2017 purchasing power parity) for FY24, which is about the same as the poverty rate in 2018. This means there will be seven million more poor individuals in 2024 compared to 2018. What should be done to bring down inflation further, increase growth, and reduce poverty? Reducing inflation requires both tight monetary and fiscal policies. While the State Bank had been maintaining a tight monetary policy with historic high interest rates, fiscal policy remained lax in terms of high fiscal deficits and government borrowing from commercial banks. Unless the government achieves a surplus in its primary balance, fiscal policy will remain lax. The good news is that under the IMF’s Stand-by Arrangement, the fiscal authorities have shown some prudence, and the first three quarters of FY24 showed a GDP surplus of 1.5pc in the primary balance, while maintaining a fiscal deficit of 2.3pc of GDP. Will fiscal prudence continue in the fourth quarter of FY24? The April to June quarter traditionally shows very high government expenditures and fiscal deficits. In FY23, the fourth quarter alone added 4.1 percentage points to the fiscal deficit, which took the FY23 deficit to 7.7pc of GDP. Similar pressures are likely in the current quarter, which will cause the fiscal deficit to mount further. Will the fiscal excesses of the fourth quarter convert the cumulative primary surplus of the first three quarters to a deficit? There is still some hope that primary accounts will show a surplus, otherwise the likelihood of getting a medium-term IMF facility will be diminished. Any policy missteps will also increase the risk of the resurgence of inflation. Growth promotion requires an increase in investment, both domestic and foreign, as well as an increase in productivity. While there is a lot of talk about attracting foreign investment, there is a dearth of focus on attracting domestic investment. Promoting domestic investment requires, among other factors, lower interest rates, which can only emerge if the inflation trajectory continues to show a downward trend. Therefore, continuing with prudent macroeconomic policies will lead to lower inflation and lower interest rates, which is conducive to higher investment. Both fiscal and monetary prudence will promote domestic savings, necessary for domestic investment. The government has already engaged with the IMF to secure a new medium-term programme that will increase the likelihood of policy prudence, at least for that period. What happens in the current quarter will be crucial for the government and our economy. While we are not in an IMF programme now, the tendency has been to go on a borrowing binge. Repeating this behaviour may cost the government dearly. It must show the foreign investors it has been wooing that it is now fiscally prudent and very serious. It must also show that our policy talk will soon translate into policy walk in the coming days. This will not be easy, as the government will be under a lot of pressure to dole out money to the usual suspects (power-brokers and resource-devouring groups) in our economy this quarter.

55,May 9 fallout,"A YEAR since the events of May 9, 2023, very little appears to have changed, at least from the political perspective. In fact, there seems to be even more bad blood between the PTI and the security establishment; both sides appear unwilling to reconsider the combative stance they have taken towards each other. In a press conference on Tuesday, the military’s spokesperson made it clear there would be no moving forward without a sincere apology from the PTI and a public disavowal of “the politics of anarchy and hate”. In response, the PTI denounced the statement as a “pack of lies” that was “full of contradictions”.  It cannot be denied that the violence directed at military symbols and installations in several parts of the country on this day last year, was a direct consequence of the narrative built by the PTI following its ouster. The party had spent months framing the possibility of its chief’s arrest as a ‘red line’, all the while blaming and shaming the security establishment for its ouster from government in April 2022. This combustible mix, triggered by the controversial arrest of Imran Khan by Rangers personnel from the premises of the Islamabad High Court, exploded in the form of unprecedented, widespread violence by PTI supporters. The PTI should acknowledge that it acted in an extremely irresponsible manner by leading its supporters towards such an unacceptable reaction. Thousands were targeted in reprisals by the state, and the events of the day accelerated the expansion of unelected forces’ influence in the state’s legislative and administrative apparatus.  However, the state, too, is not without blame. Rather than acting with restraint and demonstrating that it was only interested in getting justice for the wrong that it had been caused, it responded with extreme measures that seemed to have been taken from the playbooks of past dictatorships. For example, in seeking ‘justice’ for PTI supporters’ defacement of various installations, the homes of countless civilian suspects were raided and vandalised and their residents allegedly harassed by personnel representing the state. Even women prisoners, who otherwise enjoy special protections and concessions under Pakistan’s legal system, were repeatedly denied their right to bail and kept incarcerated without trial in scores of dubious cases. The PTI-military stand-off has been the root cause of Pakistan’s political instability. Since neither side seems interested in a resolution, perhaps the government should step in. It can offer its best resources to prosecute the May 9 cases in civilian courts, thereby ensuring a transparent judicial process. Done fairly, this will prevent the two sides from engaging directly with each other, which only seems to be perpetuating the tensions between them. It is important that this chapter be closed satisfactorily so that the nation can move forward. Published in Dawn, May 9th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832365/may-9-fallout
56,A fresh approach?,"SUCCESSIVE governments have tried to address the problems of Balochistan — particularly the province’s precarious law and order situation — with very little success. On Tuesday, President Asif Zardari, during a visit to Quetta, made a fresh attempt to tackle the issues of this tortured land. The president, while presiding over a meeting with top federal and provincial officials, reiterated the need for ‘dialogue’ between all political forces in Balochistan, while also calling for efforts to address its socioeconomic and law and order issues. A similar attempt was made by Mr Zardari and his party the last time he was in the presidency through the 2009 Aghaz-i-Haqooq-i-Balochistan package which was, at least on paper, a thorough plan designed to deal with many of the issues that have contributed to alienation in Balochistan. But today, nearly 15 years after the package was announced, separatist violence continues in Balochistan, as the underlying discontent has not been addressed. Other elected governments thereafter also announced various packages and schemes for the province, yet Balochistan’s problems remain unresolved. Unless the key factors that fuel violence and alienation in Balochistan are addressed, this vicious trend will continue. The president is right to suggest dialogue as a way out of the quagmire. But this dialogue must be meaningful, and powerful quarters within the state apparatus need to be on board for it to succeed. On the political front, instead of patronising ‘influentials’ and those seen to be loyal to the official narrative, popular leaders should be given the space and freedom to operate. The detestable practice of enforced disappearances must be ended permanently, and those suspected of breaking the law produced in court so that their fundamental rights are protected. Where socioeconomic issues are concerned, locals have the first right to the province’s resources, as well as to jobs and training. Moreover, the province’s dismal health and education indicators need to be vastly improved. This would require the state’s attention and investment in the social sector. Unfortunately, for decades, the centre has applied colonial methods to ‘tame’ Balochistan. These have included carrots — such as ‘packages’ for the province and support for sardars and feudals loyal to the powers that be — as well as sticks — such as frequent security operations. To permanently end the insurgency and bring peace to Balochistan, a democratic approach is required. Published in Dawn, May 9th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832364/a-fresh-approach
57,Visa fraud,"THE FIA has a new task at hand: cracking down on fraudulent work visas. This was prompted by the discovery of a Pakistani human smugglingnetwork in Romania, which arranged for migrants to enter the EU through such means. The smugglers not only facilitated illegal entry into the EU but also the migrants’ further clandestine movement towards more affluent European nations, exploiting their hopes for a better life. The criminal network requested 509 work permits, successfully acquiring 102, and generating illicit profits exceeding a million euros. The FIA is broadening its focus from traditional sea and land routes to include air routes through Central Asia. Smugglers now use these air pathways alongside the earlier routes from Quetta through Iran, Turkey, and Greece, charging exorbitant rates to transport individuals into Europe. The urgency to address this menace has never been clearer. The government recently organised a conference in Islamabad in collaboration with international bodies to discuss human smuggling. However, this initiative must be part of a broader, more comprehensive strategy to tackle the issue. The socioeconomic drivers of migration — unemployment, poverty, and lack of security — must be addressed. Traditional pressures and the aspiration to uplift one’s familial and social standing also contribute significantly to this risky endeavour. Treating these individuals as criminals rather than victims of exploitation only exacerbates their plight. It is vital to shift this perspective and see them as victims of broader systemic failures. The state’s role should be protective and proactive, not merely punitive. Enhanced legal frameworks, increased support for economic development in migration-prone regions, and eradication of corruption in migration processes are crucial. Additionally, enhancing the capacity and integrity of the FIA and related institutions is essential to ensure that these measures are not just temporary fixes but part of a long-term solution. International collaboration should also be harnessed to improve border management and dismantle smuggling networks effectively.

58,Most hated country in the world,"WHATEVER the Americans may have said on record, the past few weeks of the war in Gaza have proved to be quite trying for them. Central among their concerns is the hit that President Joe Biden’s re-election chances have taken as the war drags on. In the opinion polls, American voters do not actually list the war in Gaza as one of their central concerns, with the economy and abortion taking the lead. However, those that tend to complain about the economy in the US feel that the seemingly endless amount of aid flowing to Israel and Ukraine ismoney that should have been spent on improving their own situation at home. Even though the US economy is currently in the lead globally, rents and food prices at home continue to be high, causing many Americans to criticise the Biden administration’s policies. As many know, the campus protests and the fact that scores of graduation ceremonies in the US have been cancelled because protesters have vowed to disrupt them have added to the pressure, which the Biden administration has been feeling, to bring the war to an end. Even though the Democrats have stuck to their usual line of promising unconditional support to Israel and even joined the Republican-controlled House in approving $26 billion in military assistance to Israel, there has been discomfort within. Most of this comes from the internal polling done by the Biden campaign, which reveals a generational shift in the US on the issue of Israel. Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats need young voters to turn out in huge numbers if they are to win like they did in 2020. In states like Pennsylvania — a battleground state — it is precisely this group of voters that took Joe Biden to victory last time. Many of these voters were from cities like Philadelphia, which is home to many universities, and where there is an increasing feeling of reluctance to vote for Biden again, given his position on the war in Gaza. While these young people would not be lost to Trump, most would likely just stay home; and if they do, then it would be the end of Biden’s possibilities in Pennsylvania. Israel is America’s spoilt child. It is used to throwing a tantrum on the floor of the toy store if it does not get what it wants. Not too far away from Pennsylvania is Michigan, another battleground state where the Democratic Party needs large numbers of urban voters in places like Dearborn. The large Arab-Muslim population in the state is unlikely to show up for Biden if the war continues to drag on into November, and the number of Palestinian casualties continues to mount. Attempts by the Democratic Party to engage this population have not produced many positive results, with local groups showing disinterest in visits by high-ranking Democrats given their position on Israel. At the commencement ceremony for the University of Michigan, held last weekend, a huge student walkout, complete with Palestinian flags and keffiyehs, disrupted the proceedings and provided a clear statement of the shape of things to come if matters did not change soon. On one political talk show, Queen Rania of Jordan pointed out that the world simply does not understand how the US can say Israel should not bomb civilians but then continue to provide it with weapons to bomb civilians, or complain about the lack of humanitarian aid and build a pier to provide it but vote down ceasefire resolutions at the UN. It is what everyone outside the US already knows, but reiterating it to a US population reflects some level of awareness that the US will lose even more of its already flailing international reputation if the war continues. None of this promises a good or durable deal. The Israelis have been coddled by access to seemingly bottomless American coffers, and to an obstinate moral immunity for a terribly long time. Listening to the Zionist perspective often reveals their inability to understand how suddenly and decisively American public opinion has changed. Many continue to draw parallels with how Jewish students on various American campuses may ‘feel’, as well as the Holocaust. They are simply not able to see how utterly delusional their perspectives sound when considered against the more than 34,000 dead Palestinians and the horribly suffering and maimed women and children that Americans have been watching for over six months. Jewish intellectuals like the author Marsha Gessen, who compared Gaza to the ghettoes in Poland during the Holocaust, have faced derision from Zionists, but their silencing has been viewed with alarm by everyone else. Israel is America’s spoilt child. It is used to throwing a tantrum on the floor of the toy store if it does not get whatever impractical plaything or ridiculous demand it makes. It is likely to continue with its behaviour beyond an invasion of Rafah just to have the last word and pretend at some imaginary ‘victory’. There are plenty of hardliners in Israel who even imagine themselves and their country as being able to conduct wars without the assistance of the US. It is just one of the many delusions that have led Israel to where it has ended up after inflicting six months of merciless death and destruction on Palestinian civilians. Its international reputation is in the gutter, people all around the world are up in arms at its genocidal bloodlust, and now even the Americans seem uninterested in standing by their rabid child as it continues to demand a perpetual supply of Palestinian blood to satisfy its desires. Israel may be able to stall a ceasefire, and try to take the joy of peace away by insistently inflicting pain on what is left of the Gazans in Rafah. But in its pursuit of this, it will achieve nothing other than becoming the most hated country in the world.

59,Modi’s BJP toils as Indian elections lock 52pc seats,"SAMBHAL (Uttar Pradesh): People queue to vote at a polling station during the third phase of the general election, on Tuesday.—Reuters • Three Haryana MLAs ditch Modi govt to join Congress
• Police chase away Muslim voters from polling booths in BJP-ruled constituency
• X told to take down Congress leaders’ animated video over code violation NEW DELHI: With the third phase of the elections ending on Tuesday, the fate of 52 per cent candidates for the 543-seat parliament stands sealed, and analysts were reading the turbulence at the stock exchanges as a sign of difficulties for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Another sign of trouble for the Bharatiya Janata Party came from Haryana where three independent state MLAs ditched the BJP government to join the Congress party. Hitherto the flow of big and small political defectors had been in the other direction — from opposition groups to the BJP. There were reports of police chasing away Muslim voters from polling booths in a constituency in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh. Elsewhere names of some voters had allegedly disappeared from the voters’ list. In the fray on Tuesday were 94 seats spread over 12 states, including all 26 seats in Gujarat where Mr Modi and his home minister cast their votes. The day’s contests included five seats in Bihar, four in West Bengal, 11 in Maharashtra, seven in Chhatt­isgarh, 10 in Uttar Pradesh, 14 in Karnataka and nine in Madhya Pradesh, where Congress defector and BJP candidate Jyotiraditya Scindia was in the race. Of these states, Karnataka and West Bengal are ruled by the opposition. The fate of 285 seats is now sealed. The Election Commission of India (ECI) ordered X, formerly Twitter, to take down an animated video posted by BJP Karnataka but avoided directly sending a notice to the BJP. The video features caricatures of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, advancing the party’s recent messaging that the Congress is diverting funds and resources away from lower caste Hindus towards Muslims. As of Tuesday evening, the post had garnered over nine million views, and had not yet been taken down, reports said. The Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee had on May 5 complained that the video violated the code of conduct, and Manoj Kumar Meena, the chief electoral officer of the state, subsequently ordered X to take the post down. In a setback to the ruling BJP in Haryana amid the Lok Sabha election, three independent MLAs have withdrawn their support to the Nayab Singh Saini-led government in the state, reports said. The three MLAs — Sombir Sangwan, Randhir Gollen and Dharampal Gonder — made the announcement at a press conference held in Rohtak in the presence of senior Congress leader and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Haryana Congress chief Udai Bhan. After their presser, Mr Hooda claimed that the Saini government had lost its majority. Their extension of support to the Congress, he claimed, proved that there is a wave for the party in the state and that “we are poised to perform well in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls”. Mr Saini took over state reins two months ago in March after the BJP broke off its alliance with the Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janata Party and dissolved the government under chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. On the other hand, the Indian stock market has been experiencing strong bouts of volatility in recent sessions, leaving investors perplexed, reports said. Analysts have linked the fall to problems Mr Modi is facing in his third term bid. The India VIX index, which measures volatility in the Indian stock market, has surged nearly 33pc in just four sessions in May so far, following a meagre 0.30pc rise in April and a significant 18pc fall in March. On Tuesday, after opening higher, Indian stock market benchmarks, the Sensex and the Nifty 50 soon fell almost a per cent each on an all-round selloff. Both indices, however, pared losses and ended about half a percent lower each. Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832189/modis-bjp-toils-as-indian-elections-lock-52pc-seats
60,Our sluggish disinflation,"WHAT goes up must come down. This truth also applies to economic trends, which exhibit cycles of ups and downs. However, the pace of going up and coming down depends not on gravity, but economic policies. We are now seeing the effects of higher interest rates, which are slowly taking the steam out of inflation in the consumer price index (CPI). Year-on-year inflation has come down from its peak of 38 per cent in May 2023 to 17.3pc in April 2024. How long does it take to contain high inflation and to lower it? If we take high inflation to mean anything higher than 15pc, then the current spell has been persisting for the last 22 months. The bad news is that in our inflation history, we have witnessed CPI inflation persist above 15pc, peaking at 29.3pc, for 28 months straight — from July 1973 to November 1975. Let us hope that this inflation history does not repeat itself in terms of the length of that spell. If we take high inflation to mean anything in the double digits (10pc or higher), then we have experienced a spell of high inflation that lasted for almost 46 consecutive months during 1972-1976. Another episode of inflation pertained to the global financial crisis of 2008. CPI inflation in Pakistan shot up above 10pc in January 2008. After touching a peak of 26.1pc, it started to decline, but stayed over 10pc for 18 consecutive months till June 2009. However, just after five months, inflation again crossed single digits and stayed at higher levels for almost 30 consecutive months till June 2012. These episodes of high inflation show that once inflation starts spiralling, it is not only difficult to bring it down, it also takes a long time to do so. This is one of many reasons that central banks around the world aim at maintaining price stability around a low, single-digit inflation figure. The current pace of sluggish disinflation could have been speeded up had the government shown fiscal prudence or the State Bank increased the policy rate beyond 22pc. However, the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee made the right move in not stifling the economy by killing growth altogether in FY24. Will fiscal prudence continue in the fourth quarter of FY24? Inflation is not the only malaise hurting us. With the onslaught of high inflation, our real GDP declined by 0.2pc in FY23, and is expected to grow around 2pc in FY24. This is a combination of low growth and high inflation known as stagflation. The inflation history cited here was accompanied by high growth of 6.8pc and 7.5pc in FY73 and FY74, respectively. The economic situation is much worse now, perhaps the worst in our history in terms of low growth and high inflation. This combination is playing havoc with the poverty situation. While Pakistan had commendably reduced its poverty rate between 2001 and 2018, this progress has slowed down due to macroeconomic instability, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the devastating flood of 2022, and unending political polarisation. The World Bank recently estimated the lower-middle-income poverty rate to be 40.1pc ($3.65 per day at 2017 purchasing power parity) for FY24, which is about the same as the poverty rate in 2018. This means there will be seven million more poor individuals in 2024 compared to 2018. What should be done to bring down inflation further, increase growth, and reduce poverty? Reducing inflation requires both tight monetary and fiscal policies. While the State Bank had been maintaining a tight monetary policy with historic high interest rates, fiscal policy remained lax in terms of high fiscal deficits and government borrowing from commercial banks. Unless the government achieves a surplus in its primary balance, fiscal policy will remain lax. The good news is that under the IMF’s Stand-by Arrangement, the fiscal authorities have shown some prudence, and the first three quarters of FY24 showed a GDP surplus of 1.5pc in the primary balance, while maintaining a fiscal deficit of 2.3pc of GDP. Will fiscal prudence continue in the fourth quarter of FY24? The April to June quarter traditionally shows very high government expenditures and fiscal deficits. In FY23, the fourth quarter alone added 4.1 percentage points to the fiscal deficit, which took the FY23 deficit to 7.7pc of GDP. Similar pressures are likely in the current quarter, which will cause the fiscal deficit to mount further. Will the fiscal excesses of the fourth quarter convert the cumulative primary surplus of the first three quarters to a deficit? There is still some hope that primary accounts will show a surplus, otherwise the likelihood of getting a medium-term IMF facility will be diminished. Any policy missteps will also increase the risk of the resurgence of inflation. Growth promotion requires an increase in investment, both domestic and foreign, as well as an increase in productivity. While there is a lot of talk about attracting foreign investment, there is a dearth of focus on attracting domestic investment. Promoting domestic investment requires, among other factors, lower interest rates, which can only emerge if the inflation trajectory continues to show a downward trend. Therefore, continuing with prudent macroeconomic policies will lead to lower inflation and lower interest rates, which is conducive to higher investment. Both fiscal and monetary prudence will promote domestic savings, necessary for domestic investment. The government has already engaged with the IMF to secure a new medium-term programme that will increase the likelihood of policy prudence, at least for that period. What happens in the current quarter will be crucial for the government and our economy. While we are not in an IMF programme now, the tendency has been to go on a borrowing binge. Repeating this behaviour may cost the government dearly. It must show the foreign investors it has been wooing that it is now fiscally prudent and very serious. It must also show that our policy talk will soon translate into policy walk in the coming days. This will not be easy, as the government will be under a lot of pressure to dole out money to the usual suspects (power-brokers and resource-devouring groups) in our economy this quarter.

61,Fly on Great Wall,"AS our great neighbour becomes greater by the day, we are moving from being ‘another brick in the wall’ to nothing more than a fly on the wall — the Great Wall, that is. Geographical proximity and the mostly congenial nature of ties notwithstanding, do we really know China? Folklore in the Gilgit-Baltistan region would have you believe that before the ancient mountain passes fell into disuse, one could run with a hot chapati and arrive on the Chinese side with the bread still warm. Exaggeration, perhaps, but the road distance between Islamabad and Tash- kur­gan, the Chinese border town, via the Khunjerab Pass is half the distance between the federal capital and Karachi. Besides the fabled Silk Road, the Great Wall, the Xinjiang region, and the names of a few cosmopolitan centres like Beijing and Shanghai, most of us would be hard-pressed to name a couple more cities or regions. All of it can’t be blamed on the lack of curiosity on the part of China’s neighbours, particularly in the subcontinent. The ebb and flow of our interest in knowing China has also been regulated by policy decisions in great Chinese capitals over the millennia. How two of the greatest civilisations on earth can live cheek by jowl and yet be barely acquainted has been discussed in detail by Shyam Saran, former diplomat and author, in his wonderfully narrated book How China Sees India And The World. Two of the greatest civilisations barely know one another. How the subcontinent and China have managed to remain indifferent towards each other for most of recorded history is marked by epochs of respectful distance and eons of self-importance bordering on disdain on the latter’s part. In the first millennium, people of the Middle Kingdom regarded India with some awe as an emblem of Eastern sophistication and spirituality. In the second millennium, everything beyond the core of the Mandate of Heaven began to be considered ‘barbaric’. Trade caravans through the storied Silk Road — in reality, a microcosm of routes and maritime exchanges through the ports in southern India — preceded the even more talked-about Indian export, the teachings of Lord Buddha. Monks from both sides crisscrossing the mountain passes, Central Asian steppes, sea routes, and the Tibetan plateau never outnumbered the merchants of silk, porcelain, jade, and spices. Tibet and the fight over it between the two neighbours came much later. It’s unimaginable today that Tibet, a Shangri-La wrapped in a mythical mist between 8th and 9th CE, extended its control to present-day Yunnan, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and the Mongolian People’s Republic. Images of Tibet for us swing between the sublimity of Buddhist monasteries, to things as pedestrian as a plaza famous for auto parts in Karachi, and a moisturiser-cum skin-lightening agent named after snow from the roof of the world. The difficult-to-translate Arab tradition of al-wala, wal-bara (embrace the beneficial and disavow the harmful) can be seen at work during Mao’s speech to the politburo in 1962, before the Indo-Chinese border war. While describing the ‘one-and-a-half’ prior wars between them, he declared a skirmish between a Tang dynasty diplomatic mission to India in 647 CE and a local adventurer who tried to usurp King Harsha’s throne in Kanauj a full war, whereas Timur’s attack in 1398 merited only the status of a ‘half war’, owing to his Mongolian identity. How interesting that a Muslim invasion against their coreligionists’ rule in India, and the indiscriminate horror unleashed by the conquering hordes, is owned by another country, albeit half-heartedly because of Timur’s Mongol identity. Ev­­eryone outside of the Middle King­dom, the centre of the Chinese civilisation between the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, qualified, at best, as ‘half-Chinese.’ This sort of accounting can also be described as ‘too clever by half’ or ‘dedh-hoshyari’, its Urdu equivalent. The two-way influences of the Chinese and Indus-Gandhara civilisations are too numerous to list here. A few disparate ex­­a­mples are ‘Tanchoi’, commonly known as the ‘Banarasi’ sari, which derives its name from three Gujarati artisans who travelled to Shanghai in 1856 as apprentices to one Mr Chhoi, a famous silk weaver. ‘Tan’ means three in Gujarati dialects, and when the weavers returned to Surat, Tanchoi was born. As demand for the fabric decreased, the artisans and their craft shifted to Banaras, and the name has stuck since. ‘Zen’, meaning meditation, evolved from the Sanskrit word ‘dhyana’. ‘Bokhara’, is a variation of ‘vihara’, meaning monastery. Central Asia was a bastion of Bud­dh­ism before the Muslim influence. Archae­olo­g­ists like Aurel Stein called the entire Cen­tral Asian zone ‘Serindia’.

62,Gaza’s fate,"WAKING up yesterday to the news that Hamas had accepted a ceasefire proposal came as a pleasant surprise, but it did not last long. It was accompanied by reports of Israel’s long-threatened infiltration into Rafah, a day after it had urged 100,000 ‘civilians’ to evacuate a city in Gaza that has become a refuge for almost 1.5 million Palestinians. The sector subsequently began to be pounded — presumably with ammunition supplied by the US and UK — under the apparent assumption that any Hamas operatives in the area would not have left among the tens of thousands who evacuated on foot, by vehicles or on donkey carts. Almost every international ally of the Zionist regime has seemingly tried to talk it out of invading Rafah, yet their weapons keep flowing to Israel. Global history is peppered with instances of hypocrisy, but seldom have they been as egregious or stark as in 2024. In the past, sufficiently serious cautions from Washington have often produced the desired effect by at least temporarily reducing Israeli excesses. Benjamin Netanyahu, however, falls in a different category. Any semblance of a pause in hostilities, let alone a sustainable ceasefire, would spell his doom. The revived demonstrations in Israeli cities are by no means dedicated to securing a ceasefire, although some of the protesters support that goal. Their demands on Gaza are somewhat more oblique, but invariably entail the return of the surviving hostages — which would inevitably involve at least a temporary cessation of hostilities. But any kind of peace, however fragile, does not suit Netanyahu. Apart from the indictments for corruption, he presides over a regime that ignored — possibly deliberately — the clear warning signs of a Hamas assault against kibbutzim on the periphery of Gaza, populated to a considerable extent by Jews who do not buy into the narrative of exclusively Jewish nationhood. Peace of any kind does not suit Netanyahu. Netanyahu and his more vicious allies are almost as contemptuous of conciliatory Jews, Israeli or otherwise, as they are of Palestinians. In their blighted vision, the Jewish students participating in protests in the US, UK or Australia are far more problematic than the goyim who can more easily be dismissed as antisemitic. The anti-genocide protests have been spreading beyond the US to Europe and even Australia, with the encampments routinely derided by antagonistic politicians pointing out that Jewish students feel intimidated — albeit presumably not as much as children, women and men in Gaza, where the death toll since Oct 7 is approaching 35,000. Later this week, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) is expected to vote on whether to admit Palestine as a full member, yet a probable vote overwhelmingly in favour of the proposition won’t cut ice with the Security Council, where the US veto will prevail, as it has so many times whenever a challenge to Zionism has been considered. Almost 50 years ago, in November 1974, Yasser Arafat addressed the UNGA, having arrived with his holster and an olive branch, famously declaring: “Today I have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighter’s gun. Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand”. In his landmark speech, Arafat decried Zionist acts of “barbarism” and the “temerity” of the “Zionists and colonialists … to describe the just struggle of our people as terror”. A couple of decades before the post-Oslo Palestinian Authority he initially presided over became a handmaiden of the Zionist occupation, Arafat pointed out to the UN that “when it became obvious that the Palestinians would not recuperate one inch of Palestine through exclusively political means, our people had no choice but to resort to armed struggle”. He made no mention of a two-state so­­lution, which is currently the favoured option among many of those who have contributed over the decades towards diminishing the possibility of such an outcome. Arafat held out a long-term hope for “one democratic state where Christian, Jew and Muslim live in justice, equality and fraternity”. That remains a dead man’s dream. Neither a one-state nor a two-state outcome is on the cards, and that would not change with Netanyahu’s replacement by a superficially less obnoxious figurehead. The drift towards Palestinian genocide dates back at least to 1947-48, and the resistance to it has been equally evident since then. The olive branch that Arafat brought to the UN didn’t fall. It was effectively wrested from his hand. All too many olive trees have been chopped down since then, particularly after the Oslo ‘process’, when the trend towards illegal settlements was ramped up, backed by successive US governments. Replacing the Netanyahu regime with an equally absurd alternative would only mean that, a further 50 years hence, future generations will still be marvelling at the impotence of their ancestors. mahir.dawn@gmail.com Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832151/gazas-fate
63,Something’s gotta give,"IT has been almost a year since May 9. In the coming days, much will be said and written about this unfortunate day, its significance and tragedy. There will also be heated discussions about the many individuals accused — imprisoned or not — and the unrepentant PTI. But as with much else, there will be little serious discussion on how to move forward in a meaningful way, because honesty is rarely possible in public discussions. And a candid discussion would focus on the relationship between the establishment and the PTI and how this impacts the country. Take the PTI first. Notwithstanding the gloomy predictions about its demise and the quick departures of its stalwarts 12 months ago, the party managed to do well in the elections despite all the odds against it. But now, it seems stuck once again in old and new challenges. Even when in power, the PTI was a noisy organisation with little discipline. In these trying times, this hasn’t changed. With limited access to Imran Khan, the party appears to be a headless chicken. And, as old rivalries are maintained in time-honoured PTI tradition, new entrants such as lawyers and the older lot of politicians are also jostling with each other.  Decision-making has become even more chaotic. Dependent on when party leaders can meet Khan and who talks to the media after meeting him, the decisions at times are the famed ‘U-turns,’ while at others it seems that the entire lot is stuck at a roundabout, unable to locate any exit. Consider the choice of KP finance minister. It seems that the chief minister-designate was able to ignore Khan’s instructions because of his personal discomfort. Or the absolute confusion about who was going to be the party’s choice to head the Public Accounts Committee. For weeks, there was no clarity on whether or not Sher Afzal Khan Marwat, a missile who lands as often on the PTI as it does on its rivals, would be the party’s choice or someone else. The issue was resolved with the party choosing Sheikh Waqas, according to Dawn, but after much drama, with little logic. Poor decision-making has been held responsible for the party’s misfortunes rather than its run-ins with the establishment. This may not matter in the long run. What is more critical is the party’s limited choices. Its popularity is now at a point where it can no longer be denied by anyone — but it comes at a cost. Keeping in mind the mood of the electorate, the PTI will lose support if it reaches an understanding with the current set-up or the establishment. (The PML-N’s diminishing support proves this.) But neither can it sustain the stand-off. The establishment faces just as difficult a choice as the PTI. Consider the dynamics in KP, where the initial euphoria is giving way to criticism; Ali Amin Gandapur especially, and the party in general, are being accused by workers of being compromised. This has been particularly true of the government’s silence in the face of the disappearance of a PTI worker in recent days. Indeed, every small ‘instance’ of compromise or inaction is being seen as a sign of betrayal — such is the level of emotion. But without developing a working relationship with the centre or the establishment, how will the party govern? For now, the party has no answers. (Similar pressures are at work in Punjab.) However, this is not just a dilemma for the PTI, but also the establishment, which historically has always engaged with popular forces after confrontation. This happened with the PPP in the 1980s and the PML-N in the noughties. Many argue it won’t be any different this time, though of course the time frame in each of the two cases has been closer to a decade. But that was when the country wasn’t in the midst of an intractable economic crisis — a principal reason why the PTI has become the force it is. Indeed, carrying the burden of an unpopular government as well as the economy is not all that easy for an establishment that has usually been able to lay claim to public support from regions such as Punjab. But this time around, there are no goodies to share to make up for sidelining a popular party; in fact, there is just bad news in the shape of taxes or higher bills. It appears, as the last one year indicates, that the only way to manage such a situation is to use repressive measures on ordinary people, politicians and mainstream and social media.  The problem, however, with an enforced quiet is that it has to be enforced — continuously. Even then, it cannot overcome the lack of legitimacy or support; which is why in the past the establishment has always opted for a ‘reset’ eventually. In other words, the establishment faces just as difficult a choice as the PTI. If nothing changes, the pendulum will continue to swing in Khan’s favour. Consider that before Khan was arrested, there was chatter about how he continued in comfort at the expense of his party and its members. But then, he was arrested and the criticism died down. Now it is worth asking what the price of easing restrictions on Khan will be. Will it be possible to control the public reaction if he is allowed out in public in the near future, even in terms of a simple court appearance? And if there is no ceasefire, how will the establishment manage public anger and expectations, especially as it prepares for the next IMF programme? That there is realisation of this explains the constant pressure for or discussion of how the political parties need to ‘talk’. Doubting Thomases find it hard to believe this stems from the charter of democracy fandom or those who want to cheer on the establishment and the PTI together. A year on, something has to give.

64,PSO proposes swapping debt for stake in public sector companies,"Pakistan State Oil (PSO) said it is in talks with the government on a plan to acquire stakes in public sector energy companies and offset mounting debt it is owed by firms such as the national airline. Stopping the pile-up of unresolved debt across the country’s power sector, and ultimately settling it, is a top concern of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with which the government will begin talks this month for a new long-term loan deal. “Everything will be done through competitive bidding and we will participate and if we win, the stakes will be offset against (PSO’s receivables),” said Syed Muhammad Taha, the managing director and chief executive of the state-backed oil marketer. “That is our proposal and this is under consideration, so we are working with the government,” Taha said in an interview on Wednesday with Reuters. The government, with a stake of about 25 per cent, is the biggest shareholder of PSO, but private shareholders own the rest. Government officials, including the petroleum and information ministers, did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.  According to the IMF, the total circular debt in Pakistan’s power and gas sectors stood at Rs4.6 trillion, or about 5pc of GDP by June 2023. Circular debt is a form of public debt that stems partly from failure to pay dues along the power sector chain, starting with consumers and moving to distribution companies, which owe power plants, which then have to pay fuel supplier PSO. The government is either the biggest shareholder or the outright owner of most of these companies, making it tough to resolve debt as fiscal tightening leaves it strapped for cash. Among other steps sought by the IMF, the government has raised energy prices to stop the buildup of debt. But the accumulated amount still has to be resolved. Taha said the IMF reforms helped the sector by boosting creditors’ ability to pay, which will continue to improve. PSO’s aggregate receivables from government agencies and autonomous bodies stood at Rs499bn, the largest share owed by gas provider Sui Northern Gas, whose largest shareholder is the government. PSO’s annual report last year said the crisis of owed debt was a serious issue for it. Taha said PSO had initially floated the idea of acquiring stakes or complete ownership of assets such as power plants in Nandipur in the northern Punjab province and Guddu in southern Sindh, as well as the government-owned holding entity for power generation companies. It also discussed equity stakes in profitable public sector companies such as the Oil and Gas Development Co (OGDC), he added. Taha said PSO was also a part of the broader settlement framework to privatise Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which would potentially include a “clean asset swap” and a stake in the airline’s non-core assets, such as property. The government is putting a stake ranging from 51pc to 100pc in the debt-ridden carrier as part of the public-sector reforms sought by the IMF. In March, media said the principal alone that PIA owed PSO for fuel supply amounted to roughly Rs15.8bn. Taha added that he expected modest growth in demand for petroleum products as the economy opens up, thanks to lower interest rates and higher disposable income. As economic conditions improve, he added, PSO is working with big strategic investors from China and the Middle East to upgrade and expand Pakistan Refinery. PSO has a network of 3,528 retail outlets in addition to 19 depots, 14 airport refuelling facilities, operations at two seaports and the largest storage capacity of 1.14m tonnes.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832452/pso-proposes-swapping-debt-for-stake-in-public-sector-companies
65,Axe falls on another senior taxman,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has agreed in principle to suspend another senior taxman, who sought adjournment in a case involving Rs456 million in tax payments, for allegedly demonstrating lack of commitment to resolving tax concerns, Dawn has learnt through reliable sources. They said FBR Chairman Zubair Tiwana forwarded the name of Sahibzada Abdul Mateen, chief commissioner of Medium Taxpayers Office (MTO), Karachi, to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for suspension or removal from his current position. Mr Mateen will become Inland Revenue Service’s (IRS) second senior officer after Yousif Hyder Shaikh, chief commissioner-IR, Large Taxpayers Office, Islamabad, who was suspended with immediate effect for 120 days on April 23 on the same charges of seeking adjournment in a case in the Islamabad High Court. A senior tax official told Dawn that the competent authority in such cases is the prime minister. “As of today, I can confirm that no notification has been issued [about suspension of the officer],” the official said; however, the notification is expected to be issued on Thursday (today). According to the source in MTO Karachi, the issue relates to a request for an adjournment in a tax case pending before the Sindh High Court. The adjournment did not indicate that the tax was waived or that any commitment was made not to pursue it. The source said the FBR would issue a notification suspending the officer for 120 days. The FBR chairman has transferred more than 20 senior tax officers based on an intelligence report that they fiercely challenged their removal from posts. He also removed the IRS tax policy member, who was also an official spokesman for the FBR. The FBR chairman has yet to appoint a spokesperson, and avoided responding to numerous messages sent to him as well as his IRS member operation for comment on the matter. Mr Tiwana, the IRS member operation and Customs member policy enjoy their current assignments, whereas all other top tax officers have been placed on special duty (OSD). Based on intelligence information, a drive has been launched to remove senior tax officers from the IRS and Customs departments and make them OSD. However, many officers suspected that a pick-and-choose approach was used throughout the process, as many officers with tainted reputations continue to hold high-level positions in the field because of their connections with those at the helm.

66,Economic crisis deepens amid political instability,"KARACHI: Industrialists and analysts express growing concerns as political protests and wheat farmer demonstrations escalate, casting shadows over business activities and economic stability. The business community, already beset by high inflation and interest rates, feels that political issues overshadow economic priorities. “A rising tide of unrest and protests against the government has cornered the economy, making it difficult for businesses to operate effectively,” one businessman stated anonymously, reflecting the prevalent fear of backlash for speaking out. Some traders and industrialists note that persistent political disturbances have dashed hopes for stability after visible economic improvements compared to last year. Industrialists, analysts lament govt yet to develop long-term growth strategy “There is no sign of stability in the government, which reflects rising vulnerability in the economy,” said Aamir Aziz, an exporter. “Daily remarks from the Supreme Court and high courts on political and corruption issues leave us in limbo, particularly concerning our future strategies,” Mr Aziz said. He emphasised the need for a well-defined economic and political roadmap to attract investment. A Karachi-based head of research noted that trade and industry were not clear about the economy’s future, and the present government has yet to develop a long-term growth strategy. He lamented that economic growth, which must be the government’s priority, has been put under the shadow of inflation and interest rates. He said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has also failed to spur growth or bring down inflation and appears to be overwhelmed by the challenge. The private sector is working with least participation, which will bring down the growth rate to even lower than two per cent this year. “Despite sovereign default, Sri Lanka recovered within two to three years and the current inflation is 7.5 per cent. This is not a miracle but management,” he said. Some bankers believe that the SBP is managing the exchange rate, and this stability may vanish in one go. Amid these economic challenges, analysts also noted some positives, such as Saudi investors’ interest in major Pakistani assets, which could temporarily bolster the country’s external accounts. However, the looming need for $25 billion for debt servicing next fiscal year and a persistent trade deficit threaten to offset these gains. “The stable exchange rate is not the benchmark for the economy’s growth. It is only a sign that the country can pay back the dues and be able to trade with any country,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market. He noted that the current account deficit has significantly decreased, yet the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves are largely borrowed, showing no clear policy on managing external and domestic debts.

67,Six-month deadline extension for upgrade agreements irks refineries,"ISLAMABAD: The Petroleum Division has requested the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) to extend the deadline for signing upgrade agreements with five domestic refineries for six months until October this year, but most refiners smell a rat for the delay. “The government seems to be more focused on attracting foreign investment, which is no doubt important, but it needs to realise that foreign investment flows in only when existing foreign and local investors are listened to,” said Adil Khattak, who is chairman of Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) and chief executive officer of Attock Refinery Ltd. He said the deadline for signing upgrade agreements with the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) was April 22, 2024. Three refineries — Attock Refinery Ltd, National Refinery Ltd and Pakistan Refinery Ltd — gave consent to sign the agreements before the deadline, while two other refineries — Parco and Cnergyico — needed more time. However, the “Petroleum Division didn’t arrange signing with the willing refineries, nor extended the deadline date in time to accommodate Parco’s request”, he said, adding that ARL, NRL and PRL plan to invest $3bn on their upgradation projects. The total investment will increase to $6bn when Parco and Cnergyico join in. Excessive delays cause about $4bn loss in last four years It may be noted that the refining policy had already taken more than four years to develop, causing the country to lose about $4bn due to these delays. Interestingly, the Petroleum Division has now moved a summary to the CCoE days after the deadline expires, seeking a six-month extension even for those ready to start working immediately on upgradation to Euro-5 fuels. The Petroleum Division said the Pakistan Oil Refining Policy for Upgradation of Existing/Brownfield Refineries 2023 was approved by the Federal Cabinet in February to upgrade the existing refineries to produce environment-friendly Euro-V fuels and decrease the production of furnace oil. The policy provided an incremental incentive of 2.5pc on HSD (in addition to the current 7.5pc) and 10pc on petrol in the form of deemed duty for seven years to achieve this objective. The incremental incentive has been deposited in an escrow account maintained by Ogra with the respective refinery for meeting up to 27.5pc of the upgrade projects’ cost. Ogra is to allow withdrawal of funds from the escrow account by the respective refinery, post financial close of the Upgrade Projects, and against expenditure made for each milestone or the deliverables. To avail the said incremental incentive, the refineries were required to execute Upgrade Agreements, open an Escrow Account with Ogra and provide Rs1bn bank guarantee to Ogra within 60 days of notification of the Policy i.e. by April 22, 2024. The policy required the deemed duty to be cut from 7.5 to 5pc for refineries that do not sign the upgrade agreement by the said deadline. The petroleum division confirmed that “ARL, NRL and PRL have conveyed their readiness to sign the Upgrade Agreement” and requested the Petroleum Division to coordinate the signing ceremony. “However, Parco and Cnergyico Pakistan Limited (CPL), jointly contributing more than 50pc of the country’s refining output, have yet to finalise the Upgrade Agreements,” the Petroleum Division said. Interestingly, the Power Division also confirmed in the summary that Parco was in the process of updating its feasibility study, after which its board of directors will decide on the planned upgrade. “The said activities may take 5-6 months.” On the other hand, the Petroleum Division also confirmed that “a settlement agreement between Cnergyico and the Government of Pakistan for payment of (about Rs50bn outstanding petroleum levy (payable by Cnergyico) was also being negotiated”, which also could not be concluded before April 22 deadline. “In case of non-signing by the due date, the deemed duty on HSD shall be reduced from 7.5pc to 5pc for Parco and Cnergyico, making the operation of these refineries extremely challenging”.

69,PCB perplexed as Amir still awaits Ireland visa,"KARACHI: Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir is still waiting for his Ireland visa to travel to the country for the three-match Twenty20 International series that commences on Friday. The 32-year-old, who rescinded his international retirement in March to make his Pakistan return ahead of this year’s T20 World Cup, is part of the national side’s 18-member squad for the Ireland series and the four-matches against England after that. Amir, however, has been left waiting in Lahore while the remaining members of the Pakistan squad flew to Dublin on Monday. The country’s cricket board is in constant touch with its Ireland counterpart. “We are in regular contact with the Cricket Ireland officials over the matter and they have told us that Amir’s visa is still in process,” a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesperson told Dawn on Wednesday. Amir was brought back to the national camp following his decision make himself available for Pakistan in order to boost the side’s prospects of winning the T20 World Cup, which is set to be held in the United States and the Caribbean next month. Pakistan’s matches against Ireland, to be played until May 14 and those against England, scheduled to be held from May 22-30, will serve as the side’s final warm-up ahead of the T20 showpiece, which Babar Azam’s men will kick off with their match against co-hosts US. Given the importance of the Ireland and England matches, nervousness prevails in the PCB’s offices over Amir’s visa issue, which can potentially cut down the crucial match practice for the bowler, whose only international matches after a gap of four years were four matches in the recent five-match T20I series against New Zealand. Dawn understands that the PCB remains hopeful that Amir will be granted the visa, but if that does not happen, the pacer will be directly flown to Leeds, where Pakistan will play their first T20 against England. Amir, who holds temporary residence of the United Kingdom, featured in Ireland’s inaugural Test match in 2018. CI has communicated to the PCB that it is in touch with Ireland’s department of foreign affairs, which, according to the Irish board, works independently. However, officials in the PCB are perplexed at the situation, having the view that a member cricket board holds the responsibility to ensure visiting team players do not face issues related to visa processing. Amir, along with the remaining members of the Pakistan contingent, had applied for the visa after the team’s fitness camp in the country’s military academy in Kakul in March. CI did not respond to Dawn’s enquiry over the issue. Published in Dawn, May 9th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832320/pcb-perplexed-as-amir-still-awaits-ireland-visa
70,"Pakistan come back to edge Canada, face Japan in Azlan Shah Cup final"," IPOH: Pakistan and Japan won their respective matches on Wed­n­esday to qualify for the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup final in Ipoh. Both the teams top the table with 10 points each from four mat­ches. The final will be staged on May 11 at the Azlan Shah Stadium. Pakistan have registered three wins and a draw while Japan also have the same number of wins plus a draw. On Wednesday, Pakistan defe­ated Canada 5-4 while Japan beat hosts Malaysia 2-1. Malaysia and New Zeal­and are placed at third and fourth, respectively, with six points each. South Korea have registered three points and are at five while Canada with no wins, are at bottom in the six-nation invitational event. Continuing with their impressive comeback show in the event, Pakistan edged Canada. The green-shirts, who clawed back from two goals down, to register a well-deserved win, now top the six-nation event with 10 points under their belt and face New Zealand in their last league match scheduled for Friday. In earlier matches of the ongoing event, Pakistan worked their way back from 1-3 down against Malaysia before winning 5-4, and the same scenario existed against Japan in the 1-1 drawn match. Sean Davies’ field goal in the fifth minute pushed the Canadians, 19th in the world rankings, ahead of Pakistan, ranked 15. Forward Harbir Sidhu, with 25 caps under his belt, then added further gloss by scoring the second goal in the 17th minute giving Canada a solid looking 2-0 lead. But Pakistan, the three-time former Sultan Azlan Shah Cup champions, made a superb comeback with two penalty corner goals within a space of two minutes, leaving Canadian goalkeeper Matthew Sarmento baffled. Abu Bakr Mahmood struck back-to-back goals for Pakistan in the 28th and 29th minutes. Arshad Liaquat extended Pakistan’s lead to 3-2 (36th), Ashraf Waheed Rana made it 4-2 (44th) and Ghazanfar Ali nailed the fifth (45th). Canada’s Sean Davis made a field goal in the 45th minute, and Avijot Butter scored in another field attempt in the 50th that reduced the deficit to 5-4. Except for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics where Pakistan comfortably won 7-1 in a pool match, the record shows the contest betw­een the two nations have always been close. In the last 14 meetings, Pakistan won 10 times, Canada three times that included claiming a 6-0 whitewash victory over the former world champions in the 2017 Hockey World League semi-finals in London, and drawn once. Pakistan head coach Roelant Oltmans praised Canada. “Let us give credit to Canada. They played a good game and gave us a hard time today. We were only able to come back in the second quarter after being 2-0 down. Although we led 5-3, the pressure was still on us. And we had so many chances to score and even had 11 penalty corners,” the Dutch coach said after the match. “At this moment we have not thought of the last pool match against New Zealand on Friday,” he added. Patrick Tshutshani, the Canadian coach, said the dedicated performance shown by his players delighted him. “I thought we started pretty well and were fortunate to get some good moments. It was a tough competition in the second and fourth quarters, as we came under a lot of pressure too, but I am happy with the commitment given by the players,” Tshutshani said in his post-match comments. “It was a good score, but it could have been a little different and in our favour, if the players had kept the game in control and not lose focus against Pakistan. We play Japan on Friday and I hope the team plays as well as they did today.” Published in Dawn, May 9th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832323/pakistan-come-back-to-edge-canada-face-japan-in-azlan-shah-cup-final
71,Leverkusen edge closer to Dublin as another record looms,"BERLIN: Xabi Alonso’s rampaging Bayer Leverkusen will have an additional incentive in Thursday’s home second-leg Europa League semi-final agai­nst Roma: breaking a 59-year-old European football record. Avoiding defeat against Roma on Thursday will not only mean a trip to Dublin for the Europa League final, it will also extend their unbeaten run to 49 games — the best mark in European football history. A Eusebio-inspired Benfica went on a 48-game unbeaten streak between 1963 and 1965. The record has stood since, but Leverkusen have a golden chance of blowing it out of the water. Alonso’s side has already overtaken Juventus’ 43-match unbeaten run from 2011 to 2012, which was the best of a team in the top five European leagues. Already crowned Bundesliga champions for the first time back in April, Leverkusen are through to the German Cup final, where they face second-division Kaiserslautern. Leverkusen won 2-0 in Rome last week and could set up a meeting with either Atalanta or Olympique de Marseille in the final with a one-goal loss, but breaking the record would be yet another outstanding achievement in an already brilliant season. “A second leg is always a dangerous situation no matter the result before,” Alonso told reporters on Wednesday. “We are preparing to play well with good motivation and at our own game. We want to be aggressive, control and defend well as a team. We are expecting Roma to come with the hope of qualifying.” Last season, Roma defeated Leverkusen over two legs to make it to the final and Alonso said the bitter memory of that May evening would motivate them. “We haven’t forgotten what we experienced in our stadium and the feeling we felt last year. “We must use this energy and hopefully we can celebrate at the end.” The other semi-final is on a more even keel after Atalanta came away from the Stade Velodrome with a 1-1 draw after having their backs to the wall for large parts of the first leg in Marseille last week. Atalanta, whose trophy cabinet contains seven lower league titles and the 1963 Italian Cup, are looking to go one better than in 1988 when they reached the last four of the Cup Winners’ Cup as a Serie B team. Gian Piero Gasperini’s side have been inconsistent for much of the season but are eyeing a historic climax to the campaign, with a Italian Cup final with Juventus coming up next week and Champions League qualification also up for grabs. Marseille have lost their last three semi-finals in the competition and are seeking their first major European trophy since winning the inaugural Champions League in 1993. In the third-tier Europa Conference League semi-finals, Club Brugge welcome Fiorentina, who hold a narrow 3-2 lead from last week’s first leg while Aston Villa will look to make a comeback away to Olympiakos in Athens, having suffered a surprise 4-2 loss at home in the first leg.

72,Crisis-hit Bayern banking on Kane and win over Real to change the narrative,"BERLIN: Six-time Cham­pions League winners Bayern Munich head into Wednesday’s second semi-final at Real Madrid ever more reliant on striker Harry Kane amid swirling off-field crises entirely of their own making. Bayern still do not have a coach lined up for next season, with reports emerging on Monday that Julen Lopetegui became the latest to knock back the German giants, with the Spaniard chosing West Ham United instead. Bayern drew 2-2 at home against Real in the first leg and need a win to progress to Wembley, the site of their famous victory over rivals Borussia Dortmund in 2013. With Dortmund 1-0 up heading to their second semi-final at Paris Saint-Germain, a repeat of the all-German final is on the cards. Even just appearing in a Champions League final, let alone winning a seventh crown, would change the narrative surrounding Bayern’s disappointing season. Kane, famously still without a team trophy despite a decade collecting individual honours, left Tottenham Hotspur for the stability of serial winners Bayern last summer. Bayern’s stumbles and Bayer Leverkusen’s incredible unbeaten season under Xabi Alonso ended the Bavarians’ 11-year Bundesliga title streak in April. Bayern’s elimination in the German Cup at the hands of third-division Saarbruecken meant that the Champions League was their only chance of a trophy this season. While that looked unlikely when Bayern lost 1-0 at Lazio in the last 16 first leg — with coach Thomas Tuchel agreeing to leave the club just days later — the German behemoths are just one win away from a 12th Champions League final. But while the club and their hierarchy continue to suffer from self-inflicted wounds on and off the pitch, Kane is reliably carrying them to within touching distance of a Wembley return and a possible seventh crown. A member-run club without wealthy majority ownership, Bayern are consistently held up as a model of success fuelled by stable, sensible decisions both on and off the pitch. Their record with head coaches however leaves much to be desired. Since Pep Guardiola’s departure in 2016 after three years at the Allianz Arena, none of Bayern’s seven coaches have served at least two seasons. Most recently the lack of consistent thinking has been jarring. Bayern sacked Julian Nagelsmann for the crime of being one point behind leaders Borussia Dortmund in March 2023. In February 2024 Bayern agreed to part ways with Nagelsmann’s replacement Thomas Tuchel at season’s end. After failing to get Alonso, Bayern were reportedly rebuffed in their attempts to bring back Nagelsmann, now Germany coach, along with Austria manager Ralf Rangnick. Amid the ongoing crises of their own making, Kane — who arrived as Bayern’s record purchase in August for a fee of 100 million euros ($107 million) — keeps scoring to bail the club out. He now has 44 goals in 44 games in all competitions, officially his best return in a season. Kane’s effectiveness and efficiency in front of goal has turned what could have been a disastrous season into one which could end in glory for Bayern. Their preparations, though, were far from ideal with a 3-1 Bundesliga loss at VfB Stuttgart and injury to Raphael Guerreiro, who had made a good impact after coming on at half time in the first leg against Real. Bayern confirmed on Sunday he will miss Wednesday’s match. Real, meanwhile, will face Bayern as the newly crowned Spanish champions after clinching the title on Saturday. With the La Liga title all but assured, Carlo Ancelotti rotated his lineup in their 3-0 win over Cadiz on Saturday. The club is delaying the traditional celebration of its 36th league title with players and fans in downtown Madrid until Saturday to keep its focus on the Bayern game. And Ancelotti said he was confident his side could overcome Bayern to reach the final. “I am confident because this is Real Madrid, we have this squad, I’m confident in the fans who will help us,” Ancelotti told a news conference on Tuesday. “We think we’ve got it better, but Tuchel will think he does too.” Ancelotti admitted Bayern were the superior side in the first leg draw at the Allianz Arena and has warned his players that they cannot afford another sub0par performance if they want to contest the final. “We need a match with intensity, with pace... Looking at the first leg, defensively we could have done a lot more,” Ancelotti stated. “[Bayern and Real] are similar clubs because they have a great history and a lot of success. We have to respect our opponents because they did very well and better than us in the first leg. “We are very excited because it could be another magical night for us, but there is no optimism. We are aware of the difficulties that we are going to face.” Published in Dawn, May 8th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832085/crisis-hit-bayern-banking-on-kane-and-win-over-real-to-change-the-narrative
73,Last-gasp Waheed keeps Pakistan’s unbeaten run intact,"IPOH: Forward Rana Waheed Ashraf scored from a penalty corner with a minute left to play to secure a 1-1 draw for Pakistan against Japan at the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup on Tuesday that kept his side’s unbeaten run at the tournament intact. Japan had taken the lead from Ken Nagayoshi’s drag-flick conversion in the 33rd minute but Roelant Oltmans’ Pakistan came strongly in the last quarter with Waheed pouncing on the fifth penalty corner earned by his side. Despite the draw keeping Pakistan on top of the round-robin table, ahead of Japan on goal difference, Oltmans wasn’t satisfied. “We can’t be relying on set pieces all the time,” the Dutchman, whose side had won their opening two games against Malaysia and South Korea respectively, told reporters after the match. “My players should have pla­yed better, even by trying to get more field goals. As a whole, I’m not impressed with my players’ per­formance against Japan today.” Pakistan next face Canada on Wednesday and Oltmans stressed he wants his side to press the issue. “Playing catch-up is something that I don’t like, and it puts our team at risk whenever we play teams that have immense pace with them,” he added. “This has never been my strategy and to ensure that we don’t play in that way, we really need to start scoring early and dominate through our possession and defence for the rest of the match. This is what I prefer to see from my players and not playing catch-up.” Japan bossed the first two quarters but found the going tough against Pakistan. Pakistan’s Hannan Shahid, captain Ammad Shakeel Butt, Ajaz Ahmad, and Abu Mahmood had their wings clipped by the Japanese defenders but kept goalkeeper Takumi Kitagawa busy between the posts. The Japanese had four penalty corner opportunities in the second quarter but failed to score from any. Drag-flick specialist Nagayoshi, however, made no mistake with their fifth by guiding a powerful drive to the right of goalkeeper Ishtiaq Abdullah Khan. Pakistan began pushing for the leveller and after a penalty stroke was overturned on review, Waheed found the goal they desperately wanted. “Pakistan were aggressive, but we kept pressing them,” Japan coach Yoshihiro Anai said after the match. “We had more chances, but we struggled to convert them. We should have won the match.” Pakistan and Japan are tied on seven points after three matches with Malaysia a point behind in third after their 6-4 win against New Zealand on Tuesday. South Korea picked up their first points by edging Canada 1-0 in the day’s other match.

The vessel, run by the NGO Ship to Gaza, had earlier departed Norway to challenge and break the inhumane blockade of Gaza and to shed light on the consequences of Israeli actions against Palestinian children.—AFP • Negotiations resume in Cairo with Hamas calling latest round ‘decisive’
• US pauses shipment of 3,500 heavy-duty bombs amid Israeli incursion GAZA STRIP: Medical teams found a third mass grave inside Al-Shifa hospital and a seventh mass grave across Gaza hospitals, with the recovery of 49 bodies from the premises, as Israel bombarded Rafah on Wednesday amid the ongoing negotiations in Cairo and Doha for ceasefire and prisoner swap. Israel has defied international objections and sent tanks into Rafah, which is crowded with Palestinian civilians sheltering near the Egyptian border, seizing on Tuesday a crossing that is the main conduit for aid into the besieged territory. The White House condemned the interruption to humanitarian deliveries, with a senior US official later revealing Washington had paused a shipment of bombs last week after Israel failed to address concerns over its long-threatened Rafah operation. However, the Israeli military claimed on Wednesday it was reopening a major aid crossing into Gaza, Kerem Shalom, as well as the Erez crossing. But the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said the Kerem Shalom crossing remained closed. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the third mass grave, as footage from Al-Shifa hospital showed at least a dozen bodies wrapped in black plastic body bags. Standing in front of the ruins of the hospital, Motassem Salah, head of the emergency department at Al-Shifa, said several of the bodies had decomposed. Last month, around 30 bodies were reported found buried in two other graves in the hospital courtyard. After the Israeli assault in March, the World Health Organisation said Al-Shifa had been reduced to ashes, leaving behind an “empty shell” with many bodies. On Wednesday, Gaza authorities said health workers continued to uncover bodies from the complex. So far, 520 bodies have been recovered from “seven mass graves” found at three different hospitals across Gaza in recent weeks, the media office said. Since the escalation of attacks by Israeli forces in Gaza in October 2023, at least 34,844 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry. Cairo talks resume On the other hand, talks aimed at agreeing a ceasefire resumed in Cairo on Wednesday “in the presence of all parties”, Egyptian state-linked media reported. A senior Hamas official said the latest round of negotiations would be “decisive”. Hamas “insists on the rightful demands of its people and will not give up any of our people’s rights,” the official told AFP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly on the negotiations. He had previously warned it would be Israel’s “last chance” to free the scores of prisoners. However, the Israeli forces continued to conduct air and ground assault in Gaza and Rafah, after capturing Rafah crossing. Incursion condemned Meanwhile, Qatar, which hosts Hamas leaders and has been mediating between the two sides, appealed “for urgent international action to prevent Rafah from being invaded and a crime of genocide being committed”. A Palestinian analyst said Israel’s seizure of the Rafah crossing could be an attempt to create new facts on the ground, or a bid to “sabotage the truce talks”. Israel’s seizure of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing came after Hamas said it had accepted a truce proposal — one Israel said was “far” from what its own negotiators had previously agreed to. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the Rafah operation as “a very important step” in denying Hamas a passage that was essential for establishing its influence. Bombs shipment stopped Hours later, a senior US administration official speaking on condition of anonymity said Washington had “paused one shipment of weapons last week” after Israel failed to address its concerns over the Rafah incursion, which the United States has vocally opposed. The shipment consisted of over 3,500 heavy-duty bombs, the official said. It was the first time President Joe Biden, whose government is Israel’s top provider of military assistance, had acted on a warning he gave to Netanyahu in April.

75,Combating terrorism is a ‘shared interest’ with Pakistan: US,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Wednesday emphasised its ‘shared interest’ with Pakistan in addressing the critical threat that terrorism poses to the entire region. At the State Department’s daily news briefing, Spokesperson Matthew Miller also focused on the treatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and urged Islamabad not to repatriate them due to the dire situation in Afghanistan. “We remain committed to working with Pakistan to address the shared threat posed by terrorist groups throughout the region,” said Miller, commenting on a recent ISPR statement about the involvement of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in a series of terrorist attacks in the country. Pakistan has suffered greatly at the hands of terrorists, and “we regret the loss of life and injuries sustained and offer our heart-felt condolences to those affected by these attacks”, he added. Underlining the need to protect Afghans forced to seek refuge in neighbouring states, he emphasised: “We will continue to encourage Afghanistan’s neighbours, including Pakistan, to respect the non-return advisory, given the dire situation in Afghanistan.” Miller refrained from taking a stance on speculations that former prime minister Imran Khan would be released soon, stating: “We do not take position on those matters. Those matters are for the government of Pakistan to decide.” In his briefing on Tuesday, the spokesperson welcomed diplomatic engagement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, applauding Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s expected visit to Islamabad later this month. Asked to comment on the Saudi prince’s visit, Matthew Miller said: “Certainly, we always support diplomatic engagement between our partners,” adding that he did not have further details about the visit.

76,"Police, demonstrators clash at Amsterdam’s Gaza demo","THE HAGUE PARIS/WASHIN­GTON: Dutch riot police clashed with pro-Palestinian demonstrators on Wednesday after moving in to ‘clear barricades’ at Amsterdam’s main university. Images from local television outlets showed dozens of police officers (wearing riot gear) ‘exchanging’ baton blows with a group of protesters, when officers started clearing out an area in front of the Binnengasthuis building, within Amsterdam’s city centre . “The operation has been authorised by the mayor,” they stated. The UvA alleged charges including ‘disturbing the peace and destruction of property’. Images on the local AT5 channel portrayed police arresting demonstrators, numbering a few hundred. They went so far as ‘roughly pulling’ one individual off a front-end loader. Another protester attempted to stop a loader before jumping into a canal, to evade police attempts at making an arrest. Images further showed police surrounding and dragging away a small yet vocal group of protesters who remained on campus, while a front-end loader was ‘pushing material used to put up the barricades into a canal’. Protesters here too, were waving placards which read “Free Palestine” and shouted “Shame on you” at police officers. 86 detained in Paris after police removed students who had set up a pro-Palestinian camp at the Sorbonne university Police allege protesters were not ‘just’ students, but contained elements “who were not affiliated to the university and were deliberately seeking conflict with the police.” The Amsterdam city council is due to host an emergency debate regarding the ongoing demonstrations on Friday. Campus protests have also sprung up across the United States in weeks gone by, with students calling upon universities to cut direct or indirect financial ties with US weapons manufacturers and Israeli institutions. The rallies have rocked colleges campuses’ and slowly but surely, have begun spreading across the globe. Pro-Israel counter-protesters at the University of California, Los Angeles, physically attacked demonstrators at an encampment. 86 detained in France French police on Wednesday detained 86 individuals following an operation to remove students staging a pro-Palestinian occupation at the Sorbonne university in Paris, according to prosecutors. Those arrested in the police operation on Tuesday night were being held for a variety of public order offences, the statement read. They include wilful damage, ‘rebellion’, violence against a person holding public authority, ‘intrusion into an education establishment’ and holding a ‘meeting designed to disrupt order’. A handful of students are also being held for participation in a group with a view to seeking to promote violence or damage to property. They may only be held for an initial 24 hours, which can then be extended to another 24 hours. George Washington University protest Police used force in order to ‘clear’ an encampment of pro-Palestinian protesters at George Washington University in the US capital on Wednesday. In similar fashion to the events that unfolded in Paris, dozens were arrested in the latest clash with students demonstrating over the Israeli onslaught on the Gaza Strip. Members of Congress allied with the Republican Party had ‘pressured local authorities’ to act on the encampment, even going so far as summoning Washington’s mayor and police chief to testify in the House of Representatives on Wednesday. Just after 4am (0800 GMT) hundreds of officers moved in on a university quad, making numerous arrests and using pepper spray on demonstrators. Police representatives stated that 33 people were arrested for “unlawful entry” and “assault on a police officer.” Officers remained on the scene till around 10:00 am, as tents were being dragged towards a garbage truck and a student held a poster reading “Free Palestine.” For context, police had declined a request from the university to disband the encampment last month, the Washington Post had reported. At the time, they cited apprehensions about moving in against peaceful protesters. Free speech versus intimidation President Biden and universities have tried to walk a fine line between the rights of free speech and concerns about so called intimidation. On Tuesday, Biden condemned a “ferocious surge” in ‘anti-Semitism’ in a speech at the Capitol, stating “there’s no place on any campus in America, any place in America , for anti-Semitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.” Demonstrators, including Jewish student organisers, have clarified that they denounce acts of anti-Semitism. On the other hand, they accuse their detractors of conflating criticism of Israel with prejudice against Jews.

77,EU staff members protest Israel’s bombing on Gaza,"BRUSSELS: More than 100 staff members of European Union institutions gathered in Brussels on Wednesday in a protest against Israel’s war in Gaza. Protesters laid three rolled-up white sheets with red stains on them on the square outside the European Commission’s head office in the Belgian capital. On the three ‘bodies’ the words International Law, EU Treaties and Genocide Convention were written, in a protest of the way Israel has responded to the Gazans. “We’re coming together in a peaceful assembly, to stand up for those rights, principles and values that the European institutions are build on,” EU Commission staff member Manus Carlisle said. “The reasons why we work here and love to work here. Those values of human rights, human dignity and freedom especially.”  Fellow protester Simona Baloghova, who works for the European Committee of the Regions, added the protest should not be seen as a political statement.

78,World’s record-breaking temperature streak extends through April,"BRUSSELS: The world witnessed the hottest April on record, adding to an 11-month streak in which every month set a (fresh) temperature record, the European Union’s climate change monitoring service stated on Wednesday. Every single month since June of 2023, has ranked as the planet’s hottest on record, as compared to the corresponding month in previous years, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in its monthly bulletin. Including the month of April, the world’s mean temperature was the highest on record for a period of 12-months (1.61 degrees Celsius above the average), in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period. Some of the extremes which include months of record breaking sea surface temperatures, have led scientists to investigate whether human activity has now triggered a tipping point in the climate system. “I think many scientists have asked the question whether there could be a shift in the climate system” said Julien Nicolas, C3S Senior Climate Scientist. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels is the central component of climate change. In recent months, the natural El Nino phenomenon, which warms surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, has also contributed to a rise in temperatures.

79,Germany sees spate of attacks on politicians; minister struck on head,"BERLIN: German police on Wednesday arrested a 74-year-old man suspected of hitting a former mayor of Berlin in the head, the latest in a rash of assaults against politicians in Germany. Chancellor Olaf Scholz blasted the attacks against politicians as  “outrageous and cowardly”, stressing that violence did not belong in a democratic debate. Franziska Giffey was at a library on Tuesday afternoon when the suspect came up from behind her to hit her in the head and neck with a bag containing hard objects, police said. Giffey, who is now Berlin state’s economy minister and a member of Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD), was treated in hospital for light injuries. The detained suspect was previously known to investigators over  “state security and hate crimes”, said police, adding that they were investigating the motive of the attack. Prosecutors were also considering if the man should be sent to psychiatric care because of indications that he might be mentally ill. According to provisional police figures, 2,790 crimes were committed against politicians in Germany in 2023, up from 1,806 the previous year. Nevertheless, that was down from the 2,840 recorded in 2021, when the last general elections were held. Giffey said she was feeling well after the initial scare. But she was  “concerned and shaken about a growing ‘free wild culture’ in which people who are engaging politically in our country are increasingly exposed to attacks that are supposedly justified and acceptable. “We live in a free and democratic country, in which everyone can be free to express his or her opinions,” she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “But there is a clear line — and that is violence against people,” she added. Berlin’s current mayor Kai Wegner said anyone who attacked politicians was  “attacking our democracy”, as he vowed to examine  “tougher sentences for attacks against politicians”. Nazi salutes Politicians, particularly from Scholz’s SPD or coalition partner the Greens, have found themselves under increasing attacks in recent months. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the Greens was stopped from disembarking from a ferry by a group of protesters earlier this year. Another prominent Green politician Katrin Goering-Eckardt was blocked from leaving an event in the state of Brandenburg last week by demonstrators who surrounded her car and started hitting it. Giffey’s assault also came just days after a European member of parliament, likewise from the SPD, had to be hospitalised last week after four people attacked him as he put up EU election posters in the eastern city of Dresden. Matthias Ecke, 41, needed an operation for serious injuries suffered in the attack, which Scholz denounced as a threat to democracy. Four suspects, aged between 17 and 18, were being investigated over the incident. All four were believed to have links to the far-right group known as  “Elblandrevolte”, according to German media. Dresden has been a hotspot for assaults against politicians, with another case reported on Tuesday. A politician, identified by police only as a 47-year-old from the Green party, was threatened and spat on.

80,Security guard shot outside rapper Drake’s home,"Canadian police on Tuesday were investigating a pre-dawn shooting at the home of superstar rapper Drake, whose sprawling property in a tony Toronto neighbourhood remained cordoned off. Police inspector Paul Krawczyk said a security guard at the mansion on The Bridle Path road was taken to hospital with serious injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound after suspects in a vehicle opened fire. The shooting, captured on grainy security camera footage that has not been released to the public, happened at 2:09am. The guard was standing outside the gates in front of the residence when the shooting occurred, Krawczyk told reporters. “I cannot confirm if Drake was home at the time the incident occurred, but I can tell you that we are in contact with his team and they are cooperating,” the inspector added. He said the suspects fled in the vehicle, but no descriptions were offered. Police taped off most of the area. Several small orange markers, believed to indicate locations of shell casings, could be seen scattered on the road’s edge in front of the mansion.

81,"Heeramandi review — is there anything beyond the glitz, glam and fairy dust?","Within the fabric of Lahore’s walled city lies a historically rich tapestry — stories of tawaifs etched in the sand, reminders of dance against the clink of chooris and renditions of various versions of womanhood. Opulence is probably the first word that comes to mind when thinking of the new Netflix show Heeramandi. Sanjay Leela Bhansali ticks all the aesthetic boxes — the show immediately reels you into a fantastical Mughal rendering of spacious mansions, intricate outfits and dreamy lighting. Past the elaborate and maximalist world-building, I found myself deeply immersed in this world and yet, I wasn’t constantly engaged. I was searching for a story that didn’t fully take flight. This could have been a story that shifted the narrative when we look back at the history of Heeramandi. Of course, creative direction deserves its due, but there were too many things that didn’t work and for an audience looking for a story, it isn’t so easy to be distracted by “oneiric”. Watching the series was meant to be a portal into the past of Heeramandi and yet, it fell short. Of course, historical fiction comes with room for liberties, creative direction, aesthetic shifts and more but at its core, the show lacks storytelling. Initially, the plot geared us for introspection into the lives of the tawaifs of Heeramandi which swerves towards a Ram-Leela-level love affair and spirals into a Devdas-style revolution. That’s not to say Bhansali didn’t do a lot right, the women of Heeramandi carry the narrative (minus our nepo baby Sharmin Segal who plays Alamzeb). Mallikajaan (Manisha Koirala) resides as the Huzoor (Madam) of Shahi Mahal — she would live and die for the women of Heeramandi. She is fierce, unforgiving and relentless; her acting carries the show. Bibojaan (played by Aditi Rao Hydari), Mallikajaan’s daughter, is a rebel passionate about revolution. Her beauty resounds on the screen and while the eyebrow lift is jarring, her character arc is one I could get behind. From her revered mujras to her late-night escapades with the revolutionaries, Bibojaan becomes the heroine of this story.  Alamzeb, also Mallikajaan’s daughter, dreams of being a poet and leaving the shackles of her destined future as a tawaif. She meets the dreamy nawab, Tajdar (Taha Shah Badussha) and falls quickly and deeply for him. Their love story is cruel, dramatic and honestly, a little bit too on-the-nose. She reads him verses laced with a forced Urdu and passion that just didn’t hit the mark. While we do have mentions of Ghalib and Niazi, in a story that was meant to centralise the women of Lahore, we don’t hear of Amrita Pritam or Ismat Chughtai whose works highlight the plight of marginalised women. Then, we have Fareedan (daughter of Rehana, who was murdered by Mallikajaan). Fareedan (Sonakshi Sinha) is ferocious, harsh and out to avenge her mother’s death, destroy Mallika and gain control of Shahi Mahal. Her growth over the episodes was expansive and cultivated into the comraderie that always makes for a happy ending. She rules the screen, her sharp eyebrows and thirst for power awaken the story. Who doesn’t love a good anti-hero? Historically, Heeramandi was a place that taught artistic prowess. Here lies a community of woman who are the bearers of art, dance and music. Here lies a community of women known as the Queens of Lahore — they are the gatekeepers of craft, revered guardians of refined manners and aim to pass down their knowledge. The women were empowered to make their own choices and it was only after the onset of the British Raj when nawab culture was overthrown that Heeramandi became a home for sex workers. It was a crux of cultural heritage, where people came to appreciate and learn the power of dance, music and poetry. “Both the hereditary and newly trained tawa’ifs strategically deployed their shared identity as skilled performers to rise in social status vis-à-vis their power dynamic with the patrons. Apart from their artistic expertise, an essential aspect of their culture was the secret ‘art of nakhra, or pretence’ that they deployed to exploit wealthy patrons.” (Oldenburg, 1990, p. 274). The courtesans were respected and played an integral role in the preservation of the arts. In some artistic circles today, there is still talk of the enrichment that was passed down from the Mughal era (through Heeramandi). And while pieces of this history are entwined in the story, the sad reality is the lack of the raw oppression of these spaces shown in Heeramandi. It almost seems to be glamourised by fairy dust where the oppression never reaches the light — the khalas and aapas and ammis of Heeramandi are decked in jewels and lavish clothes and the suffering that should have soaked the narrative is overly glamorised.  The perfection that emanates from the walls of Heeramandi is almost uncomfortable. While patrons of art, their destinies are tied to the Nawabs of Lahore. They bring the money, the jewels, the luxury. It’s a tale as old as time — women’s fates controlled by the men around them. While outwardly queens, there is a constant reminder of the misery that walks within each of their souls. The magical realism of the sets and costumes do not make up for the filmy dialogue, melodramatic poetry and lack of plot — these women have stories to tell but they seem chained to a narrative that does not want to tell it. The sounds of the ghungroo form an eerie score for the show — a Heeramandi woman adorns her ghungroo once she has had her debut as a tawaif. Bhansali highlights the sublime, yet sweeping over the human experience to make it transcendental and evocative acts as an erasure of important stories; the plight of the women of Heeramandi (their pain, their living conditions), the Muslims living in the Subcontinent (their disconnect is confusing) and the language (the poor pronunciation and lack of fluidity of dialogue). In a lot of fiction, the body is used as a metaphor for society. And Bhansali’s period drama is no different. There was room to delve into the body politics of 1940s India and comment on the lives of the tawaifs — the overarching male gaze on one hand, the ability to speak freely of sexuality on another — where does the conversation lead? There is a layered focus on desire within the story and while the tawaifs themselves have their own desires, we only see the one reflected back to us through the male gaze. During this period, the arts were deeply connected to social class and identity (the courtesans and creators on one hand and the entertained on the other) — a transactional relationship that was steeped in the fabric of society. Music and dance act as tools to create communities and the tawaifs played a large role in that — one that must not be brushed over. Music became a part of the social construction of identity at the time and yet the show doesn’t seem to aid that narrative. Maybe Bhansali wanted to create a story that appealed to a greater audience but let’s not forget that women are the backbone of every form of creation. The tawaifs and their journeys will not be forgotten, no matter the glamour used to doll it up. Every story about a woman is a story of resistance. The end of the series was beautiful and powerful and probably one of the few scenes that left an imprint on me. The closing narration: “Like birds in gilded cages, these tawaifs knew the value of freedom…But a woman’s struggle never ends” served as the perfect culmination to a series that relied so heavily upon being perfect. And while Heeramandi explored a facet of that resistance, it too remained akin to a bird in a gilded cage, never truly showing us the cost of freedom.",https://images.dawn.com/news/1192424/heeramandi-review-is-there-anything-beyond-the-glitz-glam-and-fairy-dust
82,"‘Met Gala Massacre’ — social media slams fashion’s biggest night, the Met Gala, as Israel invades Rafah","The Met Gala took place in New York City on Monday — if you were unaware, what is often dubbed fashion’s biggest night is a parade of avant-garde fashion worn by A-list Hollywood celebrities. The gala, which attracts mass media attention, is a yearly mammoth fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. However, this year, the occurrence of the Met Gala — hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour — was heavily critiqued by netizens because of the worsening situation in Gaza as Israel amps up its aggression. On the first Monday of May, the day that marks the celebration of the gala, Israel called on Palestinians to leave eastern Rafah, amid increasing global alarm about the consequences of an Israeli ground invasion of the city. Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Anto­nio Guterres, condemned the order and said it would be “impossible to carry out safely”. Millions of Palestinians lived and were taking refuge in Rafah, however, Tel Aviv has apparently moved several brigades close to the city. As we watch the massacre of an entire nation from our phones and computers, it is incredibly difficult to celebrate the ‘first Monday of May’ and watch celebrities parade around in outfits worth hundreds of thousands of dollars (which let’s be real, they will only wear once). Meanwhile, in Gaza, threats of famine loom amidst death and destruction. The jarring juxtaposition of the two simultaneously occurring events feels dystopian (to say the least) and is reminiscent of The Hunger Games, as several X (formerly Twitter) users pointed out.   People maintained that the dystopian nature of the situation was “excruciating”, especially since pictures of injured children from Gaza were “interspersed” with images of Met Gala fashion online. “Doing the Met Gala at this moment in time feels like how the Germans were still doing big movie premieres in Berlin in 1945,” an X user wrote, referring to the second world war when Hitler’s Nazi Germany persecuted Jewish people.   Others used their platforms to direct attention to the tragedy of Gaza, and called for “all eyes on Rafah”, with one individual emphasising that it was “insane” that some were “fretting over people’s fits”. “I love fun. I love frivolity. I do. But wake up,” they urged.     There was also outrage over the cost of the Met Gala tickets, with each one selling for a whopping $75,000. One individual highlighted that the cost of one ticket could evacuate up to three families from Gaza. “The entire event is a profit-oriented display of privilege and wealth which Isnotreal will probably use to distract from bombing on Rafah,” an X user wrote.   People were also quick to highlight that high-profile events, featuring Hollywood’s elite were often used as a “distraction” to divert attention from Israeli aggression as people’s social media timelines flood with the latest pop-culture happenings. An X user maintained that “Israel always intensifies the bombing when they know the world will be distracted with a major event”.    “The Super Bowl, the Oscars, the Met Gala. They’re relying on you being distracted by terrible rich people parading around doing terrible rich people things while they invade Rafah and massacre thousands,” a netizen wrote, urging people to keep talking about Palestine.  “While you’re distracted by the Met Gala, people in Rafah, the last designated ‘safe zone’ in Palestine, are being murdered by Israel,” another user wrote.  Netizens were also quick to express severe disapproval of the Met Gala, with one individual calling it the “Met Gala Massacre”, indicating that Israel rushed to “mass evacuate Rafah and immediately start bombing” it because the gala served as a distraction. Other users maintained that they found it hard to care about the event “when Israel is actively bombing the last livable place in Gaza”.   “You think your respect for the ‘civilised’ world can’t get any more extinct but then they show you their evil, their callousness, their indifference.”  Celebrities attending the Met Gala also came under fire, with some claiming we live in a “deeply sick society”. Another user said celebrities looked “goofy… posing in their little outfits for the Met Gala”. They maintained that the celebrities’ energy was “clueless, classless and desperate.”   An individual highlighted that the “majority of these celebrities and their designers have shown no spine or remorse to what’s been happening since October 7”.  Some also made comparisons between the coverage received by celebrities on the red carpet and those mourning their deceased loved ones in Gaza. “Nine men tenderly placed Cardi B’s dress on the Met Gala floor. Yet the solitary bodies of infants bombed in Gaza by the US and Israel weigh heavier.”  Another person maintained that a “man carrying a celebrity unable to walk in her tight dress at the Met Gala is getting more coverage than a father carrying his dead child in Rafah”, referring to singer Tyla, who had to be carried up the steps of the museum because she could not move in her dress.  One X user took a kinder approach, as they encouraged people to post “simultaneously” about both Gaza and the Met Gala. “While the met is very fun and exciting, please if you are posting about the Met Gala, please simultaneously post about Gaza and Palestine and everything [that is] happening.”  Meanwhile, pro-Palestine protesters in New York converged near the Met Gala in a rally against the ongoing war in Gaza, leading to several arrests, police said. Among the rallying points were the gates of Columbia University, which has been the centre of spreading demonstrations, before protesters marched through Manhattan to American fashion’s biggest night — or at least as close as police would let them. It was unclear how many arrests were made as stars walked the carpet and posed for photos, but AFP journalists confirmed several arrests while the New York Daily News reported the number was about a dozen, out of hundreds that gathered near the soiree. Organisers on X posted a flier for an event dubbed the “Citywide Day of Rage for Gaza.” Monday’s protest appeared unconnected to the demonstrations that have rocked Columbia’s campus, culminating in the university calling the police to clear out student protesters. We can’t help but completely agree with all the tweets, it is extremely difficult to turn a blind eye to the suffering of an entire people and focus on what Zendaya and Chris Hemsworth were wearing, or who designed Lana Del Ray’s outfit.

83,Fistula and child marriages: The two epidemics plaguing women in Gilgit-Baltistan,"Seema, a resident of Astore District of Gilgit-Baltistan, received the title, ‘Woman of the Year’, not for her achievements, but for a fate imposed upon her at a tender age: child marriage. One can’t help but wonder how entering into a marriage contract at a tender age warrants this title. Visibly upset, Seema recounted her story, explaining why she received the honour. Married at the tender age of 13 and diagnosed with vaginal fistula when she was 16 years old, Seema’s existence has since become synonymous with agony. Every villager, out of pity for her deteriorating health, would visit her, oblivious to the struggle she bore in silence. With no funds for treatment, her father-in-law had even asked the doctor to give her poison — a desperate plea for relief. Before delving further into Seema’s story, it is important to understand what vaginal fistula is. The condition occurs when an abnormal passage is created between the vagina and neighbouring pelvic organs like the bladder or rectum. This can lead to numerous complications, including urinary and faecal leakage, abnormal vaginal discharge, tissue damage, kidney infections, and various other symptoms. Doctors warn that untreated fistulas can escalate to reproductive system cancers, potentially even leading to death. Seema described the pain to be so agonising that she wished for a quick death on several occasions. It’s a stark contrast to the dreams that typically fill the heart of a 16-year-old girl — dreams of a future adorned with aspirations and possibilities. However, Seema found herself teetering on the precipice of despair, grappling with the grim reality of her life-long disease. It only makes sense for her to be called the ‘Woman of the Year,’ doesn’t it? Her journey isn’t merely reflective of the far-reaching consequences of fistula but is also a testament to the devastating consequences of child marriage. According to a Unicef report an estimated 18 per cent of young girls are wed before reaching adulthood [18 years of age], amounting to almost 19 million child brides in the country. The number of unreported instances is believed to be even higher. As per the National Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC), Pakistan has the sixth highest number of women married before the age of 18 in the world. The adverse impacts of early marriage are manifold, encompassing the deteriorating health of the young bride, high-risk pregnancy, and impediments to both her education and personal growth. Moreover, in developing countries such as Pakistan, the unregulated cycle of childbirth places a heavy financial strain on parents, as they struggle to support multiple children, ultimately perpetuating poverty within these families. Despite tireless global campaigns and legal enforcement in these countries, the insidious practice of child marriage persists. This prevalence is fuelled by a glaring lack of awareness regarding the severe repercussions of such unions, amplifying the issue. The plight of girls under 18 is particularly dire, as depicted in Seema’s case. Her story serves as a stark reminder of the health complications faced by these young brides face. From debilitating conditions like fistula to a myriad of other ailments, many women are condemned to a lifetime of anguish. While some manage to recover through treatment, others suffer without ever experiencing improvement in their health. Dr Sajjad Ahmed, who offers free treatment to patients at Koohi Goth Hospital in Karachi, said that a significant number of women travel long distances from remote areas to seek treatment at the hospital located in the port city’s Bin Qasim Town. This reality underscores the inadequacy of basic facilities accessible to women in Pakistan. At the other end of the country, Dr Sher Shah and his dedicated team annually organise medical camps in Gilgit, offering treatment and performing surgeries for fistula patients free of cost. While minor cases receive care at City Hospital Gilgit, those requiring more intensive procedures are referred to Koohi Goth Hospital in Karachi. Dr Sher Shah mentioned how the hospital serves patients not only from across the country but also extends care to individuals from Afghanistan, Iran, Sharjah, and Yemen. Drawing patients from the farthest corners of Sindh, Punjab, Chitral, and Gilgit-Baltistan, including the remote locales of Skardu, Diamir, and Ghizar, individuals recover under their expertise. The hospital has provided free surgeries to almost 40 patients from Gilgit-Baltistan alone. Despite the invaluable services rendered, the absence of more specialised hospitals for the condition remains a gap in the country’s healthcare infrastructure, he added. Dr Nazneen Zamir Farooqi, a gynaecologist at City Hospital Gilgit, gets patients from remote areas of Gilgit-Baltistan, including Diamer, Astor, Skardu, Kharmang, Darel, and Ghizar. In many of these regions, the scarcity of healthcare facilities and the absence of skilled attendants during childbirth worsen the problem. “The pervasive practice of child marriage significantly contributes to this crisis. When young girls are married off, their bodies are ill-equipped for childbirth — a biological reality — as physical maturity is typically achieved post-puberty,” she explained. Consequently, girls under 18 years face heightened risks of complications, and if they contract fistula, their suffering is only magnified. Throughout pregnancy and childbirth, the absence of adequate treatment can result in a spectrum of deformities in women’s bodies, often leading to the onset of debilitating diseases. Among these, fistula stands out as one of the most distressing, inflicting not only physical discomfort but also profound psychological and social ramifications. Girls married off at a young age have underdeveloped bodies and fragile bones. If they undergo childbirth before their bodies have fully matured, they are at risk of developing fistula. Similarly, older women who have borne numerous children may experience weakened muscles, rendering them incapable of delivering the baby during childbirth. In some cases, it may also lead them to develop this condition. In both scenarios, giving birth to a child becomes an excruciating process for the woman, wherein the pressure exerted by the baby’s head against the muscles between the bladder and the vagina may result in the formation of a fistula. In many cases, the babies are stillborn. Without immediate medical intervention, the affected woman is condemned to endure the pain. The Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929, a federal law in Pakistan in alignment with international conventions on children’s rights, unequivocally condemns a marriage involving a girl under 16 years of age and a boy under 18 years of age as a violation of fundamental rights. Although each province in Pakistan has established its own regulations, in the absence of specific provincial guidelines, national law takes precedence. Any breach of this law carries severe penalties, including imprisonment for up to six months and fines reaching up to Rs50,000, meant to serve as a deterrent against such grave infringements. As per the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) conducted in 2016-17, the prevalence of child marriages in Gilgit-Baltistan, especially in areas such as Chilas, Darel, Tangir, and Kharmang, stands alarmingly high, soaring to approximately 26pc. Despite concerted efforts to tackle the issue, including the introduction of legislation in 2015, progress has been hindered by opposition within the legislative assembly, leading to delays in its enactment. While the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 is in place, its enforcement in these regions falls well short of the mark. And without a legal mandate imposing age restrictions, many see no obligation to adhere to the law. Subsequently, the absence of robust legislation and effective enforcement mechanisms perpetuates the cycle of child marriages, leaving the issue entirely unresolved. Child marriage is not merely a tradition; it has a direct bearing on human health and development. While marriage may bring a sense of satisfaction for many, it also entails significant responsibilities, demanding mental, physical, and financial preparedness. Experts argue that minors lack the maturity essential for a thriving marriage, posing potential health risks. We cannot afford the luxury of complacency while the innocence of our children is sacrificed at the altar of an archaic practice. It falls upon each of us, as guardians of our collective conscience, to demand comprehensive legislation that will dismantle the structures perpetuating child marriages. For the sake of our daughters and sons, for the preservation of their health, dignity, and dreams, we must act decisively. The time for rhetoric has passed; it is now time for action.

84,2024 Elections: What’s at stake for India’s minorities?,"If the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi succeeds in winning a third five-year term in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, many fear that India’s religious minorities, especially Muslims, will see their second-class status formalised in law and practice. But for Hindu supremacy to be fully realised, which is the stated aim of Hindu nationalists, they will have to expunge India of any Muslim influence, of which there is much, historically. When Indians cast their vote in the coming weeks, they would do well to be aware of the weight of their electoral choices. And the international community would do well not to drop the ball on India. In a recent article, political scientists, Ashutosh Varshney and Connor Staggs asked the rhetorical question: “Is India under Narendra Modi … beginning to resemble the American South under Jim Crow?” referring to state and local laws introduced in the southern United States in the late 19th and early 20th century that enforced racial segregation. They explain that Jim Crow laws were aimed at blunting the Reconstruction Amendments that abolished slavery and gave equal rights to Blacks. They were designed to make Blacks second-class citizens. Similarly, in India, Hindu nationalists seek to diminish the constitutionally guaranteed equal citizenship of Muslims and turn them into marginalised, less than fully equal citizens. Jim Crow laws lasted for almost a century, ending only in the 1960s. Varshney and Staggs claim that since Hindu nationalism is in its early phase, it could still be forestalled before it is institutionalised via political and legislative processes. They suggest that the ongoing national elections present an opportunity for Indians to do that. However, the comparison between Jim Crow and Hindu nationalism diverges in their ultimate objectives. While Jim Crow merely targeted the equal citizenship of Blacks, Hindu nationalism has a more totalitarian goal. To fully grasp the end-goals of Hindu nationalism or Hindutva, it is necessary to read its foundational texts. There are none more seminal than We or Our Nationhood Defined (1939) by Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, who led the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) from 1940 to 1973. The RSS is considered the heart and soul of the vast network of Hindu nationalist organisations, of which the BJP is the political wing. Narendra Modi, a life-time member and former official of the RSS, credited it for grooming him to political leadership. In his text, Golwalkar writes of his wariness of “hostile elements” within the country that “act as menace to national security”, singling out Muslims as the number one threat, followed by Christians. His solution to “the danger of a cancer developing into its body politic” was offering the “foreign element” two options: “either to merge themselves in the national race and adopt its culture or to live at its mercy so long as the national race may allow it to do so, and to quit the country at the sweet will of the national race”. MS Golwalkar. Credit: Golwalkarguruji.org — image via Scroll.in Another of the movement’s foundational texts is Essentials of Hindutva (1923) by Vinayak Damodar Savakar, who is considered by many to be the foremost Hindutva thinker. In Essentials, he provided Hindu nationalism with an ideology, which in a nutshell claims that India was special, as it offered something nobody else could — Hindu thought. This unique Hindu supremacy, Savarkar believed, was under threat because of the presence of non-Hindus. He called on Hindus, fragmented as they were, to unite and reclaim their supremacy. Violence against Muslims, Savarkar said, was the means to achieve that goal. Golwalkar drew on Savarkar’s thoughts. He also admired the race theories of fascist Germany and Italy and recommended that Hindustan, the land of Hindus, should profit from their lessons. In We or Our Nationhood Defined, he wrote: “To keep up the purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her purging the country of its semitic races — the Jews. Race pride at its highest has been manifested here.” Golwalkar saw the world in apocalyptic terms. His objective was clear: “To rule over the world was the heavenly task ordained to Hindu race.” He called upon Hindus to “rally to the Hindu standard, the bhagwa dhwaj [and] set our teeth in grim determination to wipe out the opposing forces”. Some Hindutva leaders today have explicitly articulated this vision. For instance, in March 2020, a Hindu priest named Yati Narsinghanand, who is the president of Akhil Bharatiya Sant Parishad (All India Priests Council) and someone close to the BJP, was reported to have told his followers, “Humanity can only be saved if Islam is finished off. Hindus: Read the Gita along with Mahabharat, and learn how to die fighting.” This call was made around the time BJP leader Kapil Mishra was leading processions in Delhi calling for violence against the mainly Muslim participants in protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, chanting the mantra: “Desh ke ghaddaron ko, goli maro saalon ko [Shoot the traitors of the country].” In 2023, another BJP leader, an MLA from Telangana, T Raja Singh, at a rally in Mumbai, urged his audience to take to arms. “I would like to request all my Hindu brothers that the coming time is the time of struggle, it is the time of war,” he said. “Every Hindu is obliged to unite. Hindu should not become one who rings temple bells, but rather he should become a Hindu who kills landyas”, a derogatory reference to Muslims. At a public meeting of Hindu priests in December 2021, in the holy town of Haridwar, a star speaker, Annapurna Maa, the general secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha, was heard exhorting her audience:  “If you want to eliminate their population, then be ready to kill them and be ready to go to jail. If only a 100 of us become soldiers and each of us kills 20 lakhs of them, we will be victorious…” Modi is circumspect in his speeches now, but was not always so. As chief minister of Gujarat, soon after the pogrom there in 2002 during his term that left at least 2,000 dead, mostly Muslim, he was often reported in his public speeches to evoke visions of a religious struggle of good over evil. “This is the holy place of shakti [godly power], the power for extermination of asuras [demons],” he said in one speech. “We have resolved to destroy and stamp out all forces of evil…” Beyond the goal of cleansing the Hindu land of the “cancer” to save the nation, there is another equally compelling reason for the Hindutva project to be more than just about marginalising Muslims. That has to do with the fact that India today is, in the words of historians Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot, “an intricate montage assembled from assorted material”, of which the Islamic is a critical element. The desire on the part of Hindutva leaders to fully realise Hindu supremacy will also require extirpating Muslim life and Muslim imprint from today’s India. Historians view the era between 1200 AD and 1750 AD (Medieval India in history textbooks) as the foundation for the highly diverse human landscape of modern South Asia, with its pluralistic culture that draws on both Indic and Islamic traditions. In their magisterial work, India Before Europe (2006), Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot show how the Central Asian ethnic heritage, Persian cultural orientation and Islamic religious affiliation of North India’s ruling elite class in the period after 1200 AD led to the dissemination of many innovative elements through the subcontinent. While acknowledging that the encounter between Indic and Islamic peoples and cultures led to short-term conflicts, Asher and Talbot note the vast degree to which cultural practices inspired by Perso-Islamic traditions became integral to the subcontinent as a whole in the long run. South Asia’s art and architecture, its political rituals, its administrative and military technologies and even its popular religions were deeply inflected by the new forms. This composite culture, the authors note, forms the basis of India that exists today, in its foods, dressing and music, languages that people speak, the built architecture, and its popular religions, among others.

Credit: Lyon, Edmund David (1825-1891)., Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons — taken from Scroll.in In the south of the peninsula, the ‘Hindu’ Vijaynagara empire (1350-1550) drew significantly from Islamicate influence in military technology, secular architecture, courtly dress, as well as local languages. The successor ‘Muslim’ sultanates of the Bahmani state in the Deccan too, followed in this tradition, most importantly in their patronage to local languages, so much so that Golconda rulers, around today’s Hyderabad, occupied an important place in the historical memory of Telengana language — with one of the sultans, Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah (1550-1580) often called Ibharama Chakravati by Telgu poets. Bijapur’s Ibrahim Adil Shah II (1580-1627), called Jagat Guru, authored a collection of songs in dakani, Kitab-e-Nauras (book of nine rasas), that opens with an invocation to Saraswati, Hindu goddess of learning, followed by praise of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and then the Chisti saint Gisu Daraz. These were no exceptions. In Bengal, the Hussain Shahi (1493-1538) rulers adopted local customs, such as purification by the water of Ganga at coronation ceremonies, and the Sufi poet, Saiyid Sultan (d 1648) published a genealogy of prophets of Islam, called Nabi Vamsha that included the Hindu god, Krishna. In Gujarat, amid the flourishing literary tradition that the Ahmad Shah rulers patronised was the Sanskrit work Raja-Vinoda (pleasure of the kings), written in honour of the ruler, Mahmud Begada (1460s), presenting the sultan as an ideal Indic king, whose court was graced by the presence of the Hindu deity Saraswati, the goddess of learning. In Malwa, in central India, capital Mandu had fine libraries that included among their collection the track Nimat-nama (c. 1500), an illustrated recipe book for making dishes suitable for all seasons, including vegetarian as well as meat-based, with illustrations drawing on both Persian and Indic tradition, including the Bhagwata Purana. However, it was the Mughals, especially Akbar (1556-1605), who helped create a state that was more Indian in character. The aesthetic that developed under Akbar’s guidance was composed of a fusion of Timurid and Indic models, and which went on to set a standard for subsequent Mughal arts and culture, including food, architecture and courtly dress and culture, Asher and Talbot argue. Besides, in the realm of built architecture, of which there is ample evidence, literary production was an important site of Indic and Islamic collaboration. Examples are the translation of Ramayana and Mahabharata in Persian (Razm-nama) and Abul Fazl’s including in his Ain-i-Akbari, extensive sections on “the learning of India” — including philosophical schools, music, life cycle rituals, and modes of image worship. The scale of the borrowing led Audrey Truschke, a prominent historian of Sanskrit at the Mughal court, to conclude that these were efforts on the part of Abul Fazl to convince Akbar’s supporters of the virtues of infusing Sanskrit knowledge into Indo-Persian thought. The tendencies towards synthesis had significant consequences. Man Singh, the highest ranking noble in Akbar’s court, only after his sons, built temples throughout the domain, including the Govinda Deva temples in Vrindavan, the largest in North India, in a recognisably Mughal style, and helped to spread Akbar’s belief in multiculturalism, just as Abdul Rahim Khaan-e-Khanan did by commissioning an illustrated Ramayana. Among the most consequential contributions of the Mughal court to Indian letters, Allison Busch shows, was its engagement with Brajbhasha. A local (Hindavi) dialect of the region around Agra and Delhi, Mughal heartlands, Brajbhasha had existed until then, mostly as bhakti devotional poetry. Under Mughal patronage, it developed a sophisticated courtly style, inspired by Sanskrit poetics, and became the principal poetic language of north India. In creating the outcome, that could be described as classical Hindi, were Akbar’s nobles composing works in the language, including Todar Mal, Birbal and the Rajput nobles, as also Faizi and Abdul Rahim Khana Khanan — showing how courtly literature in Brajbhasha was nurtured within the multicultural context of elite Mughal society. There were other enduring contributions too, of this age and milieu, outside the courtly realm. A major influence in the early part of this period was Sufis, and their dispersal, throughout much of the subcontinent. By the 14th century, the practice of Sama, devotional musical congregations, and Urs, annual pilgrimage to the shrines of Sufi saints, had become established Sufi traditions. Sufi shrines drew both Muslims and Hindus, and were themselves influenced by local traditions, including the Shattari Sufis of Bengal drawing on Nath yogis, and Rishi Sufis of Kashmir who led celibate lives and practised vegetarianism. Sufism also contributed to reform in Hindu tradition, starting in the 14th century with the rise of sants, who like Sufis, were mystics, believed in a formless God, and extolled devotion to God as a primary religious practice. Kabir, the most influential, attacked rituals and customs of traditional religions, and excoriated the caste system. Guru Nanak (born in 1469), the founder of the Sikh tradition, also came from the same context. Notably, Sufism also influenced Hindu bhakti tradition, as the historian of Indian religion John S Hawley points out. This is evident in the commonalities that the latter began to show in its focus on love for God, as did Sufis, the use of poetry and music in worship, and an ethics of compassion for others. Tulsidas’s Ramcharitmanas (1575), crafted in about the same age and the middle Gangetic Awadhi milieu of Sufi poets, Malik Mohammad Jayasi (Padmavat, 1540) and Mir Siyyid Manjhan (Madhumalati, 1545), exemplified this shift. Ram, an incarnation of Vishnu, became the preeminent object of devotion, in place of Siva. It is these constructions of a cosmopolitan Indian paradigm, resulting in innovations that spoke to both traditions that Hindu nationalists must disentangle and destroy to be able to achieve their vision of a Hindu supremacist India. This will undoubtedly leave much violence in its trail. These historical accounts of co-living and co-production contradict Hindutva claims that have much purchase today, in popular as well as scholarly circles about the thousand years of conflict between Muslim “outsiders” and “local” Hindus; of forced conversions and the wanton destruction of temples. Hindu nationalists have developed a wide repertoire of suffering and victimhood of Hindus at the hands of Muslims. Evidence to support their thesis is slim. Richard Eaton, one of the foremost historians of medieval India, shows how the claim that Islam spread in South Asia by the sword is incongruent with the geography of Muslim conversions in South Asia. There is an inverse relationship between the degree of Muslim political penetration and the degree of conversion to Islam, he notes. Most conversions happened in the north west and north east — Punjab and Bengal, farthest away from centres of Muslim power. As to temple destruction, Eaton found, over a span of more than five centuries from 1192 to 1729, there were “some 80 instances of temple desecration”, well short of the 60,000 claimed by Hindu nationalists. Typically, the desecrated temples would have been associated with the authority of an enemy kingdom. The instances of desecrations followed a long-established pattern in India, of temples having been natural sites for the contestation of kingly authority, well before the coming of Muslim Turks, including their destruction. Among the most recent examples was the destruction in the 10th c of the Pratihara temple of Kalapriya near Jamuna, by the Rashtrakuta king Indra III. But as the Bosnian historian, Edin Hajdarpasic, shows from his study of Balkan nationalism in the 19th century, enthusiastic depictions of suffering convey the essence of a political threat more vividly than simple facts or documentary narratives — a phenomenon he calls “authentic fantasy”. Hindu nationalists, themselves inspired by European nationalist movements at the turn of the 19th century, relied much on the construction of suffering and victimhood of Hindus, however divorced from facts. Decolonial historiography shows how they drew on the Orientalist bias of British colonial historians, who saw the period of the previous 600 years, as a history of Muslim arrival and their dominance over Hindus, marked by Muslim fanaticism, and temple destruction, forced conversion, and Hindu oppression. In contrast to the dark Muslim medieval age, colonial historians like James Mill posited the ancient Hindu age as golden, and modern British, as liberal. Hindu nationalists in power today are seeking to inflict retribution for their perceived sufferings by rewriting history. In some cases, this has taken physical forms — such as in the destruction in 1992 of the 15th century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, a criminal act that was legitimised by the Supreme Court of India in 2019. Claims for several other historical mosques to be converted into temples have been set in motions across the country. Elsewhere, place names have been changed to erase any hint of their Muslim heritage. Allahabad is now Prayagraj, Mughalsarai station is Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction, Aurangabad is Sambhajinagar and Gulbarga is Kalaburagi. Not satisfied with occasional erasures, the BJP government has thought fit to change high school history and politics textbooks by significantly altering and in some cases, fully scrapping the sections on Mughal history.

History tells us it is also a precursor to violence. As eminent historians Aditya and Mridula Mukherjee noted recently, “…genocide of a community is often preceded by the community being demonised, their names changed, their history being erased”, claiming “these processes have begun in India and open calls for genocide of Muslims are being given in various parts of the country with amazing impunity”. More than Jim Crow South, the history of the Balkans in the late 19th century and post-Yugoslavia 20th century provides a better guide to understanding the future of minorities in India today. Hajdarpasic’s account of Balkan history alerts us to the real consequences of the claims of victimhood. Nationalists there used stories of suffering not only to inspire collective sacrifice but also to encourage mass violence against entire communities perceived as threats. He demonstrates how certain stories of victimisation in the region long outlived their original inspirations. Decades after overthrowing Turkish rule, Serbian nationalists could revive narratives about Turk-like enemies even in the late 20th century with catastrophic consequences. Tanika Sarkar, eminent historian of modern India, demonstrates similar impulse in early modern Hindu nationalist thought. Emblematic of this repertoire was Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s 1818 novel, Anandmath, whose main character, the Hindu sanyasi (ascetic) rebel, Satyanand, is engaged in a messianic battle “for exterminate(ing) all Muslims on this land, as they are enemies of God”, a recompense for “inflicting misfortune on Hindus”. The novel is set in the context of the 1770 famines in Bengal, as the East India Company was inserting itself at the expense of the Nawabs of Bengal, and that resulted in a third of the population starving to death, both Hindus and Muslims. Historians inform Muslim fakirs (ascetics) rose up, along with sanyasis, against the depredations. Sarkar calls for Anandmath, “the first explicit message in our literary history for ethnic cleansing”, one foretelling Hindu nationalist thoughts to emerge later in 20th century. Its protagonists deemed “elimination of Muslim rule and Muslim presence from the land” an act of worship of Bharat Maata (motherland), a deity that first emerged in the novel. In 1920, Savarkar and Golwalkar adopted Vande Mataram — hymn to Bharat Maata, contained in Anandmath — as  aHindu nationalist anthem. Vande Mataram was also the rallying cry of Hindu communalists in anti-Muslim violence to follow during Partition. Vande Mataram continues to inspire Hindu nationalist thoughts and action to this day. So when the terror-accused BJP MP Pragya Thakur recently instructed her audience to “keep your weapons sharpened”, to “in this world created by god … finish all oppressors, wrong-doers, sinners…”, she was deploying Anandmath’s template of the holy war — calling for violence against the entire Muslim population. It is in such violent contestations borne out of ‘authentic fantasies’ of past sufferings that Hindu nationalists of today — following that of Savarkar and other Hindutva ideologues — seek to create Hindu supremacy, by waging permanent war against India’s 200 or so million Muslims and other ‘foreign elements’. Already, United Nations experts are alerting us to the fact that “India risks becoming one of the world’s main generators of instability, atrocities and violence, because of the massive scale and gravity of the violations and abuses targeting mainly religious and other minorities, such as Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and others.” Mass atrocity experts are warning:  “If nothing is done to address these risks, India may continue to experience a rise in the number of violent (and fatal) attacks against religious minorities, an escalation in the scale of the violence, and an increased level of state involvement in atrocities.” The burden on Indian voters to use the ballot to forestall the institutionalisation of Hindu nationalism, before it reaches a point of no return, is therefore, even heavier.

85,From screens to streets: How Gen Z is disrupting the status quo and redefining activism,"Soft. Entitled. Snowflakes. Lazy. These are some of the characterisations about Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012) pushed in the media by older generations who have largely failed to connect with and understand what they are all about. But these disparaging words used to describe the generation are, in fact, baseless — these young individuals are anything but passive. To put it simply, this generation isn’t waiting for change; they’re demanding it. Over the past six months alone, they’ve orchestrated movements that have sent shockwaves through the status quo, leaving elites squirming in discomfort. It’s time to recognise their power, their passion, and their potential to reshape our world that has been long ruined by decades of complacency. Pro-Palestinian students take part in a protest in support of the Palestinians amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, at Columbia University in New York City, US, October 12, 2023 — Reuters We are seeing this play out at university campuses across America, where administrators resort to police intervention to suppress anti-war protests and encampments, only to witness a resounding backlash that reverberates far beyond their expectations. Tensions began to simmer on American university campuses soon after the terror attacks carried out by Hamas on October 7. As Israel continues to unleash an orgy of violence on Palestinians — the International Court of Justice has found it “plausible” that Israel is in violation of the Genocide Convention — the atmosphere on campuses has grown increasingly charged. Student groups have been suspended, walkouts have become increasingly common, and university towns have become the epicentre of the uncommitted campaign during the Democratic primary elections. A coalition of University of Michigan students rally at an encampment in the Diag to pressure the university to divest its endowment from companies that support Israel or could profit from the ongoing conflict on the University of Michigan college campus in Ann Arbor — Reuters Contrary to what the mainstream media would have you believe, the seething discontent isn’t confined to elite or progressive universities like Columbia and Berkeley. The numbers speak for themselves: one-third of adults under 30 say that their “sympathies lie either entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people (compared to 10 per cent or less for adults over 50), while 36pc of them believe that President Biden is “favouring Israelis too much” (compared to the 16pc or less for adults over 50). This has become a headache for Joe Biden, as he relies on the support of younger Americans to secure victory in the upcoming election in November. Demonstrators protest inside the Rockefeller Center asking for a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, as President Joe Biden attends an interview in midtown Manhattan, in New York, February 26 — Reuters The ongoing conflict is yet another testament to Generation Z’s profound empathy and commitment to equity, inclusion, and human rights. According to an Edelman survey spanning six countries, a staggering 70pc of Gen Z actively engages in social or political causes. What sets this generation apart is their digital fluency, enabling them to harness digital platforms, including decentralised media, to mobilise, educate, and advocate for change. Moreover, data shows that this generation watches the least amount of television, and prefers consuming content on platforms like TikTok (10.5 hours a week) and YouTube (6.9 hours a week). In fact, the fast-tracked nature of legislation seeking a TikTok ban in America is very much related to the fallout of the war in Gaza, and has unsurprisingly angered young Americans. Students build a protest encampment in support of Palestinians, at the University of Southern California’s Alumni Park, amid the ongoing conflict, in Los Angeles, California, US, April 24, 2024 — Reuters Engage in conversation with older generations, and you’ll often hear the refrain: “Younger generations are out of touch, indifferent, and perpetually glued to their screens.” Yet, this worry overlooks a crucial truth. As digital natives, today’s youth possess an unparalleled ability to navigate the labyrinth of misinformation, actively seek out diverse perspectives, and circumvent traditional gatekeepers, particularly within the media landscape. Their digital prowess not only connects them to the pulse of reality but empowers them to shape it with unprecedented clarity and purpose. Most importantly, Gen Z is demonstrating an unwavering commitment to a host of global challenges, spanning from climate change and gender diversity to the plight of Palestine. It speaks of their values and sense of responsibility — something their parents and mentors should not only acknowledge but also take immense pride in. Greek university and high school students take part in a demonstration against a planned bill which opens the way for the operation of private universities, in Athens, Greece, January 11, 2024 — Reuters Demonstrators and students hit a wall as they shout slogans during a protest against the Chilean public education system and the results of the referendum on a new constitution, in Santiago, Chile September 6, 2022 — Reuters From Malala Yousafzai to Greta Thunberg — the emerging cohort of leaders, particularly women — is mobilising millions worldwide. For adults, especially those clinging onto institutions and power, this rising generation represents a threat. This is not only because of the fact that these leaders and organisers are speaking truth to power, but because they are seeking to dismantle the status quo in a bid to build something better and more inclusive. Moreover, the discomfort among established elites stems from their utter cluelessness in navigating the digital landscape wielded by younger generations. This new breed of leaders is not only adept at harnessing digital tools but also possesses a deep understanding of how to use them effectively, leaving the status quo scrambling to keep pace. Demonstrators take part in an “Emergency Rally: Stand with Palestinians Under Siege in Gaza,” amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, October 14, 2023 — Reuters The unfolding events across American universities serve as a stark reminder: nothing rattles status quo elites more than the sight of peaceful protestors courageously raising their voices. This has been consistently true across centuries. Yet, amid the turbulence, organisation and activism displayed by these students is inspiring next generation of leaders around the world.

86,"People with two copies of a risk gene have genetic form of Alzheimer’s, say scientists","CHICAGO: Individuals carrying two copies of the APOE4 gene are ‘virtually guaranteed’ to develop Alzheimer’s and face symptoms at an earlier age, researchers told the international press on Monday. The study is set to redefine such carriers as having a ‘new genetic form’ of the mind-wasting disease. The reclassification may change the current norms surrounding Alzheimer’s research, diagnosis and approaches to treatment, according to the researchers. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine. “Through the data, we are saying that perhaps this is a genetic form of this disease, not merely a risk factor indication” the co-author of the study, Sterling Johnson, from the University of Wisconsin’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center told reporters at a press briefing.  Scientists have known for three decades that individuals with two copies of APOE4 gene variant, have a significantly higher risk of developing the disease, as compared to individuals with the most common version of the APOE gene, known as APOE3. About 2 to 3 per cent of the general population, or about 15 per cent of people with Alzheimer’s, have two copies of the APOE4 variant. “This study adds compelling data to suggest that people with two copies of this gene are almost guaranteed to develop Alzheimer’s if they live long enough, and that they will develop Alzheimer’s earlier than people without this gene,” stated professor Tara Spires-Jones, an Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of Edinburgh (Tara was not involved in the study). Dr. Juan Fortea and his colleagues, from the University of Barcelona conducted an in-depth study of more than 3,000 brains donated from the US National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Centre. They also delved into biological and clinical data on more than 10,000 individuals from five datasets in three countries. They found that by the age of 65, at least 95pc of people with two copies of APOE4, known as ‘homozygotes’, had abnormal levels of an Alzheimer’s-related protein termed ‘beta amyloid’ in their spinal fluid, while 75pc had positive brain scans for amyloid. Nearly all APOE4 homozygotes in the study had higher levels of amyloid at the age of 65 than people who were not carrying the risk variant. The findings suggest APOE4 homozygotes meet the three fundamental criteria for being a genetic disease. Firstly, almost all individuals with these two gene variants have Alzheimer’s biology, they all develop symptoms at about the same rate and clinical and biological changes occur in a sequence that may be predicted, the researchers stated. A Professor of the UCL Genetics Institute, namely David Curtis (who was not involved in the research), remained unconvinced of the findings. “I do not see anything in this paper to justify the claim that carrying two copies of APOE4 represents some ‘distinct genetic form’ of Alzheimer’s disease’,” he said in a statement. “No matter how many (copies) of APOE4 one carries the underlying disease processes seem similar across cases of Alzheimer’s disease” he said. The findings could have broader implications for the recently approved Alzheimer’s treatment ‘Leqembi’ by Eisai and Biogen. This a drug that reportedly removes amyloid from the brain. In clinical trials, patients with two copies of the APOE4 variant depicted much higher rates of brain bleeding and swelling associated with the treatment. In view of this, some centres shy away from treating these patients, Dr. Reisa Sperling, who worked on the study, stated at the press briefing.

87,Paris 2024 gearing up to face unprecedented cybersecurity threat,"Paris 2024 is getting ready to face an unprecedented challenge in terms of cybersecurity, with organisers expecting huge pressure on the Games this summer.  Organised crime, activists and hostile states will be the main threats during the July 26-August 11 Olympics and the August 28-September 8 Paralympics. Paris 2024, which has been working hand in hand with the French National Agency for Information Security (ANSSI) and cybersecurity companies Cisco and Eviden are looking to limit the impact of cyber attacks. “We can’t prevent all the attacks, there will not be Games without attacks but we have to limit their impacts on the Olympics,” Vincent Strubel, the director general of ANSSI, told reporters. “There are 500 sites, competition venues and local collectives, and we’ve tested them all.” Strubel is confident that Paris 2024, which will operate from a cybersecurity operation centre in a location that is being kept secret, will be ready. “The Games are facing an unprecedented level of threat, but we’ve also done an unprecedented amount of preparation work so I think we’re a step ahead of the attackers,” he said. Paris 2024 has hired “ethical hackers” to stress test their systems and is using artificial intelligence to help them ascertain potential threats. “AI helps us make the difference between a nuisance and a catastrophe,” said Franz Regul, managing director for IT at Paris 2024. “We’re expecting the number of cybersecurity events to be multiplied by 10 compared to Tokyo [in 2021].” “In terms of cybersecurity, four years is the equivalent of a century,” Eric Greffier, head of partnerships at Cisco, explained. In 2018, a computer virus dubbed “Olympic Destroyer” was used to attack the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Games. While Moscow denied any involvement, the US Justice Department in 2020 said it indicted six Russian intelligence agency hackers for a four-year-long hacking spree, which included attacks on the Pyeongchang Games. “We would like to have one opponent but we’re looking into everything and everyone. Naming the potential attackers is not our role, it is the role of the state,” Strubel said. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron said he had no doubt Russia would malevolently target the Paris Olympics. The Games will take place amid a complex global backdrop, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s military campaign against Hamas in Gaza.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1831849/paris-2024-gearing-up-to-face-unprecedented-cybersecurity-threat
88,Hasty transition,"OUT of nowhere, the government has launched a new cybercrime authority: the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency. This move to replace the FIA’s cybercrime wing raises substantial concerns about the motive behind it. The NCCIA is mandated to handle offences under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, which, activists allege, was used routinely by the FIA to silence dissent. Of course, conversely, bad actors use social media to spread disinformation and misinformation, necessitating oversight.  But at a time when digital rights and privacy remain key issues for the state to address, the authorities have opted to forgo any meaningful dialogue with digital rights groups, the IT sector, or even the public. Such an opaque approach fosters distrust and scepticism towards the government’s intentions. It has neither presented a clear rationale nor demonstrated the deficiencies within the existing framework that necessitated this move. The reuse of the FIA’s resources — personnel, assets, and existing cases — under a new banner raises a fundamental question: what exactly is the objective of the NCCIA that the FIA could not achieve? If the goal was to enhance capabilities or streamline operations, would it not have been more prudent to bolster the existing framework rather than dismantle it? The abruptness of the move suggests the new rulers are not behind it. The move will likely create redundancies and confusion, diluting the focus from actual cybercrime threats to the procedural chaos of transitioning to a new agency. Also, such disruptions could hinder ongoing operations and complicate international cooperation under links nurtured by the FIA.  Furthermore, the NCCIA, with its broad and unclear mandate, could potentially lead to increased surveillance and data collection practices, encroaching upon the personal liberties of citizens under the guise of security. It appears the PML-N government is working in the same manner as when Peca was being promulgated, when no input was taken. The situation has called into question the regulatory environment for the internet in the coming years. Ostensibly, the aim is to exert greater control over social media and to gain more power to crack down on activists, dissidents and journalists critical of state policies. The government owes the public an explanation of the necessity and aims of the NCCIA. It must articulate how this new set-up will better serve the cybersecurity needs of the nation without compromising democratic freedoms. It is also crucial that further developments in this area involve a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Engaging with experts in digital rights, cybersecurity, the legal domain, and the public is essential to ensure that the agency’s operations are balanced, effective, and respectful of the rights it is purportedly designed to protect. The urge to police social media must be resisted. Published in Dawn, May 5th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1831581
89,PAKISTAN’S MOMENT OF YOUTH,"The future of Pakistan — good or bad — will be determined by its young; most especially by those who are between 15 and 29 years of age today. This, of course, is a cliché. But it happens to be a cliché that is quite literally true. Here is why.  Pakistan’s ‘youth bulge’ is palpable. Just over two out of every three Pakistanis today are below the age of 30 and just under one in every three is between 15 and 29 years of age (our definition of youth). What the demographic momentum imbedded in this one statistic implies is that Pakistan is not just a young country, but that it is going to remain young till at least to 2050, possibly longer.  More importantly, my own research suggests that the youth of Pakistan know this and they expect being given the attention and respect this demographic reality demands. Others who have looked at the question have come to similar conclusions. But the fact of the matter is that we do not need statistics to tell us that Pakistan is a young country. You just need to look around you. Any street. Any marketplace. Advertising on your television set. Certainly, on your Twitter feed. Any political jalsa [gathering]. Any office. Even elected officials and unelected political influentials. The generational change is not on its way. It’s here. It’s set. And, most importantly, it’s here to stay. At least for, and probably for more than, the next two decades. With the majority of Pakistan’s population below the age of 30, the young will invariably influence the country’s future trajectory. However, where the youth of today take this country will depend on the choices that today’s policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make. Eos presents an excerpt from an essay by Adil Najam from the book Pakistan: Search for Stability, published by Oxford University Press…  BEING YOUNG IN PAKISTAN In 2017, the Pakistan Human Development Report produced a comprehensive profile of youth in Pakistan, including a wealth of empirical and opinion data on the young, collected from an estimated 130,000 Pakistanis. However, the key question that we, the authors of the report, were most concerned with was “what does it mean to be young in Pakistan?” Not surprisingly, no easy answers were forthcoming. Like so many other places in the world, being young in Pakistan is both exciting and frustrating. The space that the young occupy in Pakistani society is vast and full of possibilities but, in their own words, is often described as crumbling, contested and constrained on the one hand, and uneven, unfair and uncertain on the other. It is a space that is defined by high hopes, but also deep fears. As subsequent research and events have confirmed, to be young in Pakistan is to be highly agitated, and very often angry. Our research does begin pointing out some of the reasons why this is so. For example, if you were to computationally condense the over 60 million young Pakistanis aged between 15 and 29 into a statistically representative one hundred young people, you would find that just 30 of them consider themselves to be functionally literate, 29 would never have gone to school (despite all being 15 or above), only 6 would have 12 or more years of education and just 39 would be employed. More telling, however, are the structural depravations which highlight that the space ‘to be young’ is severely constrained and shrinking. Of the 100, only six would have access to a library, only seven to a sports facility, just 21 to a park. Only three would have ever been to a cinema, only three to a live music performance. Fifty-nine would say that they do not play sports, or only infrequently. One in the 100 would own a car, 12 a motorcycle, 10 a bicycle and 77 would have no means of personal mobility. Each of these depravations becomes even more acute for women, rural youth, and other marginalised groups within the young. And, yet, within this notional 100, we also found a spirit of great national pride, high aspirations, much hope, and tremendous expectations. They were eager to announce, to any who wish to ride the tiger of Pakistan’s youth, to never forget that this is a generation that demands and deserves better. They are politically excited, excitable and astute. While only 24 percent said (in 2016) that they trusted political leaders, 90 percent of young men and 55 percent of young women claimed that they would vote in the next elections. Of every 100, 48 believe that Pakistan’s future will be bright — although 36 fear it will be bleak. Most tellingly, 67 [of the 100] believe that their lives are and should be better than their parents, only 15 expect themselves to be worse-off than their parents; 89 say they feel happy; 70 say they feel safe. All of them demand the space and conditions in which they can achieve their aspirations. In short, the world of young Pakistanis is as diverse, as differentiated, and as divided as the rest of Pakistan. However, they also have greater expectations and aspirations which, if nurtured, could yield high dividends. Much more telling, however, is the palpable impatience and restlessness which, if ignored, could result in disaster. There are three things to keep in mind as we think about youth anywhere in the world, but certainly in the context of Pakistan. First, and most importantly, youth is a defining category. The reason to think of the young as a category is not just because they are so many, but because — even if they were not this many — the 15-29 year age bracket is where ‘citizenship’ matures. Second, youth is fleeting. Analytically, too, youth is a transitory and dynamic category. Because changes happen fast and furious when one is young, the definition of youth identity and what it stands for can change rapidly, even whilst within that category. Those turning 15 or 16 today can find themselves very distant from those turning 28 or 29 and will very likely not easily recognise the passions of those who would be 16 by the time they turn 28. This may well be true for other categories too but is consequential here, because the short window of this category and the rapid changes within it make notions of what “youth believe”,  “youth stand for”,  and “youth want”, or even ideas of the “youth vote”, are much more transitory and contestable than many analysts assume, and do compound the challenges of youth representation. Finally, youth — especially in Pakistan — is an extremely diverse category. At one level, any category of well over 60 million individuals cannot possibly be homogenous and would demand an investigation into its internal contradictions. But, much more than that, each of the major cleavages that exist in Pakistani society are compounded in its young: gender, class, rural-urban, wealth, technology, ethnicities, religiosity and sectarianism, and geography.  PAKISTAN AND ITS YOUNG: THREE PROPOSITIONS Building and extending on the available research, let us review three key propositions — political, societal and developmental — on how the young of Pakistan might influence the future trajectories of the country’s society and politics. These propositions are offered not as predictions or scenarios, but as choice points. Embedded within each proposition are levers of possible change — where the youth of today take this country will very much depend on the choices that policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make on each of these dimensions. Proposition 1: The young of today are defining tomorrow’s politics, but not always in ways we imagine On the face of it, the bold sounds, sights, language, and even substance of Pakistan politics today seems driven by the young. Even where mainstream political parties are still led by septuagenarians, they wrap themselves in the emblems of youth; political rallies of all parties, even religious ones, feel like high-intensity concerts; political communication is not only geared towards the young but most often crafted by them. On the one hand, this is not entirely new, nor surprising. On the other, however, there is something palpably different, as if what would have been ‘regular’ youthfulness is now on steroids. There is significant reason to believe why it is, and will remain, so. At a basic demographic level, all political actors realise how the maths works: the young are the single largest bloc of new and impressionable voters in Pakistan and there is a long-term and steady supply of them. The demography described in the Pakistan National Human Development Report suggests that every election in Pakistan between now and around 2050 will be defined by the youth vote — including, of course, by their choice to vote or not. Notwithstanding the dichotomy of young Pakistanis claiming high intent to vote and a history of not having done so in the past, the number of young entrants into the voting mix means that, mostly within two election cycles, today’s new voter would be about to — or would already have — enter(ed) a burgeoning 30-49 years middle-age category historically the most reliable and loyal voting group in Pakistan. The political logic of investing in the young voter is impeccable. But demography alone does not explain the dominance of the youth voice in Pakistani politics today. Technology seems to have played an even more defining role; a role that is likely to be as enduring. That the rise of ‘new’ (especially social) media would trigger a steep decline of the ‘old’ (particularly print) media was probably inevitable, but the ‘control’ younger political operatives now exert over social media in all political groupings is remarkable and is now driving significant parts of the political narratives in the country. Of course, certain leaders and parties have capitalised more on courting the youth vote than others and have been differently successful in it. This matters, but mostly in ways that it has always mattered. One should not expect permanence in youth loyalties, not least because it remains a dynamic and diverse category.  It remains to be seen if the current and emerging youth bulge will practically change ballot box behaviour, but conditions are certainly ripe to create the possibility. Finally, a very remarkable feature of Pakistan’s emergent political discourse is how explicit mention of youth issues is nearly absent from political narratives. This, despite the feverish pitch of the political discourse, despite the active participation of the young in this discourse, and even despite the role the young are clearly playing in shaping the narratives. A possible explanation for this anomaly could be that politically active youth in Pakistan have convinced themselves that the pathway to material benefits for themselves — particularly, for example, in the area of employment and improved living conditions — lies through the choice of political leadership rather than of policy.  Proposition 2: Give the young the ability to be young or expect a Pakistan tomorrow that is as divided as it is today The idea that we are denying the young in Pakistan the space to be young is a major finding of the Pakistan National Human Development Report. But it is a thought that first hit me like a ton of bricks in December 2014, as I visited the New Muslim College in Charsadda — just days after the horrific terrorist attack at the Army Public School (APS) in Peshawar — to hold a focus group discussion with 15-18-year-olds on what young Pakistanis were thinking. It struck me that the young men with me in the room were not much older than the students who had died at APS just a few days ago, or those who had done the horrific killing. The reality of the APS attack hung heavy in the room and I realised, as did they, that it is the young in Pakistan who have had to do much of the dying in the so-called ‘War on Terror.’ But there was also a palpably steely resolve in the room. Here is what I wrote about that encounter: “Unlike every other APS conversation I had been hearing — on television, on social media, from politicians, in drawing rooms — theirs was devoid of sloganeering. There was no sign of despair. No hollow display of anger or anguish. No camouflaging of fear with bravado. Instead, there was resolve. Very endearing. Very becoming. Very mature. A very matter-of-fact recognition that this was the reality of the Pakistan they had inherited. A reality they now have to live with…” It is then that I fully realised the perils of being young in Pakistan. “Extremists are out to indoctrinate the young. Terrorists are out to kill them. Educational institutions can neither guarantee quality education nor physical security. An emergent politics of anger uses the passions of the young as fuel for petty politicking. The result is that the space for the young to be young has shrunk — is endangered.” My research has convinced me that the best gift that Pakistan can give to its young is to return to them the ability to be young. Indeed, it may be the best gift Pakistan can give itself — a future where this ability continues to be denied cannot be good for any Pakistani. Being young is not just about being carefree, it is also about being able to explore. In the shrinking space to be able to do so, the young in Pakistan have already inherited most of the societal divides that define the country as a whole. That as many young Pakistanis consider being a Pakistani as their primary identity as consider their religion to be their primary identity, is probably reflective of society as a whole. But what was the most disturbing aspect of our research was that more than 40 percent young men and 50 percent young women disapproved of having friendly relations with someone from another religion, or even another sect; nearly three out of every four young Pakistanis (men and women) responded that they would disapprove of someone from a different religion or sect preaching their religion. The distrust that defines Pakistani society as a whole is equally prevalent amongst the young.  Just over 20 percent said they trusted politicians, only around 25 percent trust the police, just 40 percent had trust in the judiciary and less than 50 percent in the media. All of this was in 2016, and there is enough reason to believe that trust amongst the young has only eroded further since then. Such a snapshot should be read not just as what the youth of today think, but what the Pakistan of tomorrow is likely to think. The challenges of social division, societal distrust and mutual intolerance are clearly great, but solutions are available. Silly as it may sound to some, given the enormity of the challenges, the very first — and possibly most meaningful, although not always easy — step should be resolute policy in allowing the young to be young. Sports grounds are not a big investment, but they can be more meaningful than we might think. It is remarkable how parochial we have become, and simple steps to enhance mobility for the young, including the ability for travel exchange within the country to get to meet other Pakistanis who may not look like us but are equally Pakistanis, is another small but possibly impactful investment. Safe and affordable mobility (along with reliable childcare and clean bathrooms) for young women, in fact, emerges as amongst the most effective means of significantly increasing women’s participation in the workforce. Obvious as it should be by now, it is worth noting that, as we think about youth as a category for social analysis, now and into the future, the simple dichotomy of ‘young vs old’ is not only un-useful but can also be dangerous. In society, as in politics, some of the greatest and most alienating divisions that exist in Pakistan exist amongst the young themselves. The policy challenge is to find ways to reduce these divisions now before they sink deep roots and are passed on to the future, and to future generations. The goal is not empty slogans of ‘integration’, but investing in practical means for the young in Pakistan to interact with other young people in Pakistan. Across divisions of gender, class, geography, religion and rural-urban-metropolitan, the bridges that need to be built are not just of concrete but of conversation.  Proposition 3: ‘Boom or bust?’ — it’s a choice We began the 2017 Pakistan National Human Development Report with a story that is not from Pakistan. It remains valid and is worth repeating here: “On December 17, 2010, a 26-year-old fruit and vegetable vendor in a small town in Tunisia set himself on fire, following a confrontation with a municipal official about where his cart was parked. While the specifics of what led to Mohamed Bouazizi’s death are unclear, what is indisputable is his fatal self-immolation catalysed protests that toppled Tunisia’s dictator and led to a string of uprisings in the region that came to be called the Arab Spring. “The aim of mentioning this situation here is not to recount what happened in Tunis that day, or in the other countries of the Arab Spring subsequently. [Our concern is] with Pakistan’s youth. So, fast forward to Pakistan. “Can you imagine a situation, anywhere in Pakistan, where a young person feels so frustrated by unemployment, or so disheartened, un-empowered and marginalised, that he takes a measure as extreme as Bouazizi did in Tunisia? One certainly hopes not. But hope alone is not enough. It is the responsibility of the state as well as society to enable an environment for our youth where such a fate is not even imaginable. Not even in our worst nightmares.” Trying to predict whether Pakistan’s demographic youth momentum will end up being a ‘boom’ or a ‘bust’ is a fool’s errand. That Pakistan today has the largest number of young people it has ever had and that this number is set to grow over the next multiple decades, is a fact. How this fact will play out is not a matter of reading tea leaves, it is a matter of policy choice. There is the inherent potential of a ‘boom’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new young entrants into the economy can become motors of consumption, generators of ideas and innovation and harbingers of new social energy. There is also the equally inherent potential of a ‘bust’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new entrants into the economy need new employment, can feel suffocated by the lack of room to grow, and can burn with anger when existing systems they wish for are not enabled to change. Certainly not as simple as it may sound, but the final path taken does depend on the choices made by policy, by society, and by the young themselves.

90,ESSAY: HAUNTED BY HER MEMORIES," In war, one of the most affected segments of society is women. They endure the worst fears before the war, try to withstand the humiliation and torture during it and, if they survive the rapes and ravages of war, they end up living with memories that haunt them for the rest of their lives. Three of the best films that beautifully capture this trauma of war in lingering memories of women are Hiroshima Mon Amour, Mrs Dalloway and Sophie’s Choice. Two of these are based on writings by women: Virginia Woolf and Marguerite Duras. Meanwhile, the third owes a lot to its female protagonist, Meryl Streep. Perhaps one of the first women writers to capture the trauma of war in the 20th century was Virginia Woolf. So, we begin our discussion with Mrs Dalloway, which resonates with the memories of the First World War. Woolf was not even 60 when she drowned herself in 1941, haunted by her own depressing memories of the First World War and fears of an impending annihilation of civilisation during the Second World War at the hands of the Fascists and the Nazis. She was in her thirties when she witnessed the horrors of the most destructive war, from 1914 to 1918. Seven years after the end of WWI, Woolf completed her novel, Mrs Dalloway, which examines one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a Londoner married to a parliamentarian. With most Western governments refusing to even acknowledge how the holocaust in Gaza has particularly impacted children and women, Naazir Mahmood takes a look at three Western films that have hauntingly depicted the trauma of war on women and on their lingering memories of it MRS DALLOWAY AND WORLD WAR ONE Just as in her first novel — The Voyage Out — which she wrote at the beginning of the war, Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway also reflects her psychological vulnerabilities. With a plotless narrative, the novel moves along mainly in the characters’ consciousness, addressing a journey of self-discovery and death. Woolf is masterful in crafting stories that address the nature of time in personal experiences. In her novels, she presents multiple interwoven stories and Mrs Dalloway is no exception. Clarissa Dalloway is preparing for a party that she is planning to host the same evening. The story of the mentally damaged war veteran, S.W. Smith, is particularly striking in both — the novel and the film. The film version of Mrs Dalloway (1997) bears the mark of three other women: Eileen Atkins, Marleen Gorris and Vanessa Redgrave. As Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the titular role, is more well-known to movie watchers, a word about Eileen Atkins and Marleen Gorris is in order here. Atkins wrote a brilliant screenplay for Mrs Dalloway that Marleen Gorris directed. Dutch-born Gorris is also the first woman director to win an Oscar in the best foreign language film category, for Antonia’s Line in 1995. Her films mostly investigate what it means to be a woman in a challenging world that men dominate. Mrs Dalloway is one of her best movies, though it remains underrated, as Marleen Gorris herself acknowledged. Vanessa Redgrave depicts Mrs Dalloway as a disillusioned socialite, whose mood fluctuates between delight and depression. Her suppressed symptoms of depression are visible throughout the film. She appears to question — and at times regret — the choices she has made. Her memories haunt her, as she reflects on the life she could have lived with another man, whom she rejected for a dull but more stable person, who becomes a member of parliament. But perhaps the most crucial character in the film is that of Smith who, in an earlier scene, watches his friend get blown up in the ‘no-man’s land’ of the trenches in France. Five years down the line, he still suffers from ‘shell shock’ and has a panic attack outside a shop where Mrs Dalloway pauses. Nearly all characters realise and suggest that World War One unleashed horrors that keep poisoning their lives. HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR AND THE ATOM BOMB While the film Mrs Dalloway is indebted to four women: Eileen Atkins (screenplay), Virginia Woolf (novel), Marleen Gorris (director) and Vanessa Redgrave (actor), the French film Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959) has the mark of another two women: Marguerite Duras as the writer and Emmanuelle Riva as the main female lead. Hiroshima Mon Amour, too, deals with memory and its insufficiency and treacherousness in the aftermath of a major war. In both movies, the women want to retain what they should, but their hopes appear to be fake and forced. The director of Hiroshima Mon Amour, Alan Resnais, beautifully crafts a movie from the screenplay by Marguerite Duras. Hiroshima Mon Amour is one of the best movies of the French New Wave, with an atmosphere that is both foreboding and strange. It is a tame movie, in which a woman recounts her memories of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. There are newsreels and footage of victims, protests against war and memorials in the post-war Hiroshima. As opposed to Mrs Dalloway, which shows London five years after WWI, Resnais’s movie presents Hiroshima 14 years after the first atomic bomb hit it in 1945. While Mrs Dalloway is plotless, Hiroshima Mon Amour also defies any prior narrative structure. The French novelist and playwright Marguerite Duras opened her eyes in 1914, the year WWI started; and as Virginia Woolf had observed WWI, Duras was an eyewitness to WWII. Like Mrs Dalloway, Hiroshima Mon Amour also lacks any real story. There are two accidental lovers: a French actress visiting Hiroshima and a Japanese architect-cum-businessman drawn into a two-night affair with her. It becomes a sad and sensual affair, as the love between the two revolves around a film on peace. While exploring the influence of war on both French and Japanese culture, the conflict between the inhumanity of war and the human side of love stuns you in this brilliant film. This documentary-style film recollects the memories of the Japanese man who fought for his country in WWII, whereas the French woman recalls her days in Nevers, France, when she madly fell in love with a German soldier, who would only come to die in her arms. Fourteen years after the war, her memories deeply unsettle her, as she unexpectedly recounts those powerful feelings of longing and love that have disappeared from her life, as they did from the life of Mrs Dalloway. Profoundly painful memories mesmerise the viewers in this movie, as emotions erupt at a slow pace. SOPHIE’S CHOICE AND AUSCHWITZ Alan Pakula — who in 1962 had produced To Kill a Mockingbird and received a nomination for best picture — directed Sophie’s Choice 20 years later, in which Meryl Streep snatched the Oscar for best actress. Sophie’s Choice stars Meryl Streep as Zofia (Sophie), a Polish immigrant to America, with highly discomforting memories from her dark past, before and during WWII. While Mrs Dalloway made her choice to marry a dull person for the sake of his high status in society, and the unnamed French actress chooses to love a soldier from the Nazi occupying force in France, the film Sophie’s Choice is about an extremely hard decision a mother has to make. In this film, Sophie has to grapple with her memories as a Holocaust survivor and flashbacks reveal her harrowing story from Auschwitz. After the war, she lives in America with a Jewish man, having a fragile mental state. Like the other two films, essentially Sophie’s Choice is also about a woman struggling with her past and regretting the choices she made, or had to make. In Sophie’s case, the choice becomes apparent only at the end of the movie, when she reveals to her young lover what she went through under the Nazi occupation of Poland. When she arrives in Auschwitz, a Nazi officer forces her to choose which one of her children would go to the gas chamber and die. In the beginning, the movie is slow and at times tedious, but as it progresses and more of her story becomes known, the film grabs its audience. In the final minutes of the film, the harrowing scenes of the concentration camp move you to tears. Sophie has a tough choice to make and, if she fails to choose, both of her children would lose their lives. In utter desperation, she chooses her son to live with her, while reluctantly allowing her daughter Eva to go to the gas chamber. The three films we have just discussed have a common streak of memories and regrets, of choices and their aftermaths, and of the devastating impact the war has on women. While the American, Dutch, English, French and the Japanese have all contributed to these films, now, in the face of the death and destruction in Gaza, hardly any developed country is inclined to make such moving films about the children and women in Gaza. The utter destruction and humiliation that has become the fate of Palestinians is in no way less regrettable than the holocausts in Europe and Japan.

91,PSYCHOLOGY: SINGLES AND ATTACHMENT STYLES,"Are all single people insecure? When we think about people who have been single for a long time, we may assume it’s because single people have insecurities that make it difficult for them to find a partner or maintain a relationship. But is this true? Or can long-term single people also be secure and thriving? Our latest research, published in the Journal of Personality, suggests they can. However, perhaps unsurprisingly, not everybody tends to thrive in singlehood. Our study shows a crucial factor may be a person’s attachment style. Singlehood is on the rise Singlehood is on the rise around the world. In Canada, single status among young adults, aged 25 to 29, has increased from 32 percent in 1981 to 61 percent in 2021. The number of people living solo has increased from 1.7 million people in 1981 to 4.4 million in 2021. People are single for many reasons: some choose to remain single, some are focusing on personal goals and aspirations, some report dating has become harder, and some become single again due to a relationship breakdown. With singlehood on the rise around the world, what does the latest research tell us about being single and happiness? People may also remain single due to their attachment style. Attachment theory is a popular and well-researched model of how we form relationships with other people. An Amazon search for attachment theory returns thousands of titles. The hashtag #attachmenttheory has been viewed over 140 million times on TikTok alone. What does attachment theory say about relationships? Attachment theory suggests our relationships with others are shaped by our degree of “anxiety” and “avoidance”. Attachment anxiety is a type of insecurity that leads people to feel anxious about relationships and worry about abandonment. Attachment avoidance leads people to feel uncomfortable with intimacy and closeness. People who are lower in attachment anxiety and avoidance are considered “securely attached”, and are comfortable depending on others, and giving and receiving intimacy. Single people are often stereotyped as being too clingy or non-committal. Research comparing single and coupled people also suggests single people have higher levels of attachment insecurities compared to people in relationships. At the same time, evidence suggests many single people are choosing to remain single and living happy lives. Single people represent a diverse group of secure and insecure people In our latest research, our team of social and clinical psychologists examined single people’s attachment styles and how they related to their happiness and wellbeing. We carried out two studies, one of 482 younger single people and the other of 400 older, long-term singles. We found overall 78 percent were categorised as insecure, with the other 22 percent being secure. Looking at our results more closely, we found four distinct subgroups of singles: • secure singles are relatively comfortable with intimacy and closeness in relationships (22 percent) • anxious singles question whether they are loved by others and worry about being rejected (37 percent) • avoidant singles are uncomfortable getting close to others and prioritise their independence (23 percent of younger singles and 11 percent of older, long-term singles) • fearful singles have heightened anxiety about abandonment, but are simultaneously uncomfortable with intimacy and closeness (16 percent of younger singles and 28 percent of older, long-term singles). Insecure singles find singlehood challenging, but secure singles are thriving Our findings also revealed these distinct subgroups of singles have distinct experiences and outcomes. Secure singles are happy being single, have a greater number of non-romantic relationships, and better relationships with family and friends. They meet their sexual needs outside romantic relationships and feel happier with their life overall. Interestingly, this group maintains a moderate interest in being in a romantic relationship in the future. Anxious singles tend to be the most worried about being single, have lower self-esteem, feel less supported by close others and have some of the lowest levels of life satisfaction across all sub-groups. Avoidant singles show the least interest in being in a romantic relationship and, in many ways, appear satisfied with singlehood. However, they also have fewer friends and close relationships, and are generally less satisfied with these relationships than secure singles. Avoidant singles also report less meaning in life and tend to be less happy compared to secure singles. Fearful singles reported more difficulties navigating close relationships than secure singles. For instance, they were less able to regulate their emotions and were less satisfied with the quality of their close relationships, relative to secure singles. They also reported some of the lowest levels of life satisfaction across all sub-groups. It’s not all doom and gloom These findings should be considered alongside several relevant points. First, although most singles in our samples were insecure (78 percent), a sizeable number were secure and thriving (22 percent). Further, simply being in a romantic relationship is not a panacea. Being in an unhappy relationship is linked to poorer life outcomes than being single. It is also important to remember that attachment orientations are not necessarily fixed. They are open to change in response to life events. Similarly, sensitive and responsive behaviours from close others and feeling loved and cared about by close others can soothe underlying attachment concerns and foster attachment security over time. Our studies are some of the first to examine the diversity in attachment styles among single adults. Our findings highlight that many single people are secure and thriving, but also that more work can be done to help insecure single people feel more secure in order to foster happiness.

92,STYLE: THE SHOWMAN AT 30,"Hassan Sheheryar Yasin — the designer, actor, choreographer, entrepreneur known as HSY and also, Shero — has always known how to put up a show. As I write this, I wonder if perhaps he’s tired of this description that is so ubiquitously used to describe his work? Nevertheless, it’s true — Shero is a showman to the tee, conjuring up a magical joie de vivre around all that he does. When he announced a show marking his 30 years in the business, you knew that you were in for a fashion experience. And come rain, come shine, a showman knows that the show must go on. The heavens opened up over Lahore merely a few hours before the event was scheduled to begin. Mass text messages were sent out to the entire guest list, informing them that there would be a delay of about two hours. By the time the guests started coming in, the rain had subsided and the outdoor catwalk had been dried down. There was a slight breeze and a nip in the air — ideal weather for an outdoor fashion show. HSY chose to celebrate his 30 years in the fashion business by putting on an elaborate solo show.And while the clothes may have traversed familiar territory for him and did not cause any shockwaves, it was a needed reminder that Pakistani fashion still has a pulse For his 30-year celebration — the social media hashtag read #HSY30 — Shero had renovated parts of Lahore’s age-old Evernew Studios. The venue was split into past, present and future segments, with the ‘past’ particularly catching the eye.  That was an absolute passion project. A storeroom at the studio had been revamped into a sitting room for the guests. A wooden doorway marked by the designer’s signature ‘H’, and the roaring lion that is part of his logo, opened into a parlour with painted walls, a tiled floor, crystal chandeliers, old-world cupboards, sofas and leafy plants. The fragrance of motia wafted through the air. It was a throwback to 1947, the designer told me, with all the furniture actually dating back to that time and having been sourced from various people. The pictures on the walls were reprints from various eras, including images of some of Shero’s earlier work. A circular outdoor catwalk represented the designer’s present. The future was defined by multiple digital screens lined up within the arches of an old building right next to the catwalk. A pre-recorded high resolution version of the show was simultaneously aired on these screens as the models walked out. But the models celebrating Shero’s 30 years didn’t just merely walk — some strode purposefully, many danced, a few others winked at the audience as they twirled. This wasn’t just any modelling pool — the men and women on the catwalk all consisted of Shero’s friends and family. This is understandable — and, yet, in a terrain that is increasingly starved of exciting fashion, one yearns to see variations in silhouette and colour or experimentation with embellishments. 
  There were some innovations in the layering and the wedding-wear and how the clothes were not season-specific but, fashion-wise, one wanted to see more. His sister opened the show, followed by his niece and close friends. The professional models were those who had been significantly part of his three decades long journey; among them, Vaneeza Ahmed, Fouzia Aman, Amna Babar, Hasnain Lehri, Amna Ilyas, Rizwan Ali Jaffri, Aimal Khan and the designer’s perpetual muse, Mehreen Syed.  An international contingent formed the second part of the show — professionals that Shero has befriended over the years, including the head of Burberry Middle East, a creative director whose clients include Mariah Carey and Beyonce, the communication designer of Fendi, and the director of Dubai Design Week. It was a mix, comprising Pakistani fashion’s movers and shakers over the years, ‘it’ members from Lahore’s high society, and ‘real’ people from around the world. Together, they represented ‘Brand HSY’. The crowd standing all around the circular catwalk similarly signified the immense goodwill that the designer inspires, and many symbolised the various turning points in his career. For instance, veteran designer Nilofer Shahid was in the audience, and her presence was significant not just because of her seniority, but also because she had been the first person to take a chance on Shero.  Back in February 1994, when Shero had been assisting with pinning outfits in Nilofer Shahid’s show, he had managed to convince the designer to let him direct the show. From working backstage, he got promoted to show director within a day, and there has been no looking back ever since. Similarly, so many others at the show — members of the now dormant Lahore-based Pakistan Fashion Design Council (PFDC), all of Lahore’s fashion fraternity, journalists, models and a smattering of actors — represented Shero’s journey. And together, this crowd hooted and cheered and even danced to the music on the catwalk as the show proceeded. But what of the clothes, the actual raison d’etre propelling any fashion show? Opening the show was a fusion line that ran the gamut from casual statements to red carpet glam — a long gown was punctuated by a flowing cape; casual pant and shirt sets came overlapped with long jackets worked with thread embroideries; and organza was fashioned into a tunic with balloon sleeves, paired with a sequined pant. The international contingent in the second had some hot-stepping dance moves — Danny Lee, who has worked with Mariah Carey and Beyonce, was groovy! — but moving beyond the theatrics, they came out wearing clothes that varied from smart casual statements to formal-wear. The clothes were layered: a free-flowing trench coat flared over a waistcoat, a pleated kurta and pants, a fitted gown cut out at the back and clasped at the waist by a single chunky gold sequin and paired with a fitted jacket, and so on. Some of the men wore caps backwards, embellished with the ‘H’ logo and quite a few men and women held handbags or briefcases, emblazoned once again with the designer’s logo. The third and last capsule featured embellished formal-wear — saris, lehngas, sherwanis, flowing embellished dupattas. These are the designs that particularly symbolise the HSY hallmark, the luxe Eastern wedding-wear that one associates with him the most. Model Amna Babar looked glamorous in a purple sari paired with an embellished jacket, but my favourite was Mehreen Syed, stately in a heavy duty open coat, layered over an embroidered sari in red, a colour that she has always worn so consistently in Shero’s shows. And then the show ended. The designer spoke about the friendships he has forged over the years, the love that he has received, he even sang a bit. Confetti flew in the air and there was more song and dance. It was fun, fun, fun. It was a befitting celebration of 30 years in the business of fashion and, yet, one has to point out that the clothes all invariably traversed familiar territory. One has seen these particular patterns of embellishments, these silhouettes, this mix of colours in HSY’s shows before. Perhaps, in paying homage to his three decades as a designer, Shero simply wanted to bring out versions of what he considers his best work? This is understandable — and, yet, in a terrain that is increasingly starved of exciting fashion, one yearns to see variations in silhouette and colour or experimentation with embellishments. There were some innovations in the layering and the wedding-wear and how the clothes were not season-specific but, fashion-wise, one wanted to see more. But, fashion-wise, one rarely ever gets to see more. Fashion weeks have bitten the dust and most of Pakistan’s design community is happy broadcasting new collections via Instagram rather than investing time, money, sweat and tears on staging a solo show. In this dire climate, Shero chose to fly solo — to determinedly forge on despite a heavy rain shower, to eschew sponsors and invest his own finances, and to dive headlong into creating a fashion experience that reminded you that Pakistan’s fashion industry may be comfortably wedged into a commercial slump but it is still very much there. And fashion shows can still very much happen, should a designer have the passion, the foresight and be able to manage the finances. Shero made waves — though not shockwaves — and if a 30-year celebration could be this exciting, imagine the show he’ll put on when his career hits 40!

93,THE TUBE,"Jaan Se Pyara Juni | Hum TV, Wednesdays 8.00pm  Junaid (Zahid Ahmed) is a man ‘left on the shelf’ — a younger brother whose parents have died, he is forced to rely on his greedy older sister to find him a match. Used to her brother’s full attention and access to his money, Safina (Faiza Hassan) has no intention of allowing his resources to be diverted to any stranger who might become his wife. Junaid waits patiently, because he has his heart set on a local ‘it’ girl, Husan Ara (Hira Salman). Glamorous, confident and career-oriented, Husan Ara finds Junaid and most men around her under-achievers, while she is looking for an upgrade to her lifestyle. From the teasers, we see that Husan Ara’s rejection will prick Junaid into a hurried marriage to another desperate person, Meena (Mammiya Shajafar), who has also been rejected by her high-flying fiancé. This sweet little story tells us, in writer Aliya Bukhari’s words, that “your first love does not have to be your last love.” Zahid Ahmed has an intense screen presence and suppressing it for nice guy roles can backfire, but the first episode works really well, promising an entertaining show to watch out for. Beyhad | Geo TV, Wed-Thurs 8.00pm  This is a commercial project with very little nuance or effort put into any of the characters, except the negative Jugnu (Saboor Aly) and male lead Hamza (Affan Waheed). The youngest in her family, Jugnu has always been a favourite with her Hamza “bhai”, and while her crush has grown into love or even obsession, Hamza has always considered her his baby sister. Hamza is a hardworking, sensible man who has fallen in love with Soniya (Madiha Imam), who is a standard good girl with no particular aim except Hamza. She has no hopes or goals and is unaffected by wealth or education. Her terrible, materialistic mother, played by Rubina Ashraf, is another walking cliche of elite snobbery — instead of her raising a practical objection, the author has her pushing her daughter towards a wealthy psychopath (Osama Tahir). The story seems inspired from the wonderful classic Doraha, but without the emotional subtlety of the original. A restrained and generally good actor, Affan Waheed is relatable and anchors the story to reality. Like a lot of negative characters, Saboor Aly’s Jugnu provides the energy but Aly is also smart enough to initially soften the tez larrki (cunning) vibes, allowing us to see her character’s vulnerable side too. Let’s Try Mohabbat | Green TV, Saturdays 8.00pm  Wind machines and a staged “romantic” set-up on the beach seem like a signal from the new management at Green Entertainment that they are pivoting to easy, mass appeal projects. Zohan (Danyal Zafar) is afraid to tell his parents that he is in love with Fizza (Mawra Hocane) because his dictatorial father (Shehzad Nawaz) is dead set against love marriages. Fizza is made of stronger stuff and hatches a plan to “arrange” their marriage with the aid of his long-suffering mother Samiya (Tazeen Hussain). This important conversation, about a relationship going nowhere for five long years, would have been a confrontation in the normal world; instead, we are given unthinking, easygoing romance. On the plus side, focusing on the way family trauma and dysfunction can effectively stunt the growth of a younger sibling is interesting and relatable. Shallow execution aside, the screen presence of Danyal Zafar, Gohar Rasheed and Tazeen Hussain holds our attention well beyond the commercial cliches.

94,CINEMASCOPE: DEUCE AND ADVANTAGE,"Tennis is a relationship,” says Tashi Duncan (Zendaya) in director Luca Guadagnino’s new film Challengers. However, this relationship is not simply between the game and the player. Rather the heart of tennis, and perhaps of all competition, is a three-way relationship between two contestants and a third person. Their presence, and observation, is what gives competition its intensity. Challengers fuses sex and sport in a straightforward but effective way. Early on, at a junior tournament, we see friends Art Donaldson (Mike Faist) and Patrick Zweig (Josh O’Connor) fall in lust with tennis’s hot newcomer — Tashi. They’re good, but not great. Meanwhile, she’s all business, demolishing her opponents. The two boys compete for her attention and one night she ends up in their room, where they share a three-way kiss before she leaves. The match in the morning won’t play itself. The new Zendaya tennis fi lm Challengers is reviewed by an expert in the psychology of competition Patrick wins the film’s first set and he and Tashi get together. Art, however, remains a “good friend”, religiously attending her games even when Patrick doesn’t. When Tashi’s playing career is ruined by an injury, he is there to support her. The two get married and she becomes his coach, the architect of his international success. Meanwhile, Patrick’s career remains in the doldrums, though he and Tashi maintain contact. When Art’s career also hits the buffers, she suggests he play the New Rochelle tennis tournament, at which Patrick will be waiting. The psychology of competition What’s the point of all this competition? Tashi and Art are rich, thanks to their sporting success, but it’s clear that wealth doesn’t motivate them — and Art is nonplussed by the fandom that swirls around him. Perhaps it is the pursuit of excellence that drives them. This, however, is clearly not the case for ill-disciplined Patrick, who spends his time in bars and sleeping in his car, despite coming from an inordinately wealthy family. Art too seems ready to give everything up rather than ruthlessly recover his brilliance. Even Tashi, apparently the most dedicated and driven of the trio, is ready to risk professional excellence for an erotic thrill. In his 1903 essay, The Sociology of Competition, philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel argued that competition between two competitors is often aimed at impressing a third party. It is the presence of that third person that gives competition both its meaning and its intensity. What’s the point of all this competition? Tashi and Art are rich, thanks to their sporting success, but it’s clear that wealth doesn’t motivate them — and Art is nonplussed by the fandom that swirls around him. Challengers can be viewed as a representation of precisely this three-way dynamic of competition. In the film’s erotic scenes, the desire for Tashi is conditioned by the sexual charge between Art and Patrick. She is attracted to them both at various times. Having apparently “won”, Art remains insecure about his status and the presence of Patrick. The borders between sporting and erotic competition are often blurred. “If you don’t win, I’ll leave you,” Tashi tells Art. Is her incitement to rivalry between the two purely strategic, a means of pushing Art to achieve better performance? It may be. Yet she seems to enjoy the attention of either one when it is on display for the other, be it on the court or in the bedroom. Any tension can only be held so long before one starts to tire, and it is as well that Challengers reaches its stylish pitch when it does. The film ends with a genuine display of affection between two of the characters. This might lead the audience to conclude that an intimate two-way relationship can transcend the competitive urge to perform for another. Yet the very public and performative nature of that moment leaves us wondering whether even reconciliation stems from the need to be wanted, and the desire to impress.

95,Packaging film sector on the rise,"The processed food sector in Pakistan is witnessing a significant growth in demand, spurring investment in both the food processing and packaging material industries. National Foods has invested Rs7 billion to establish its largest state-of-the-art production plant in Faisalabad, and International Packaging Films, a subsidiary of International Packaging Films Ltd (IPAK), has enhanced its flexible packaging film production capacity in Lahore, bringing its total investment in its three manufacturing facilities to Rs13.5bn. Moreover, both companies plan to vigorously explore export markets for their products. “We plan to export $15-20 million worth of flexible packaging films this year, which is roughly 20 per cent of our total production capacity of 152,000 tonnes,” IPAK CEO Naveed Godil says.  Food packaging is an important growth driver, enabling consumers to look for different options and compare the value offerings before making a purchase. “Packaging also helps enhance the portability of products, preserves taste, and increases shelf life,” he notes, adding that his company holds a 38pc flexible film packaging market share in the country. ‘The total local market size is Rs80-100bn, and we expect an annual growth of 7-8pc in flexible packaging films by food companies in the country’ Pakistan’s demand for flexible packaging films is approximately 200,000 tonnes against a total production capacity of 300,000 tonnes, leaving a surplus of 100,000 tonnes for export. The company’s revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of 41pc in the last three years. The rapid growth in its revenues, fueled by enhanced production capacity, has encouraged the company to conduct book building on May 8-9 for its Initial Public Offering (IPO) through the sale of 70.1m shares, representing 10pc of its post-IPO capital, in a new stock issuance. A quarter of the shares being offered on the market will be sold to retail investors. The IPO — the 14th in the last five years — will help it raise Rs1.47bn at a floor price of Rs21 per share to partly repay its long-term debt of Rs4bn acquired in recent years for capacity expansion. Mr Godil explained, “The total local market size is Rs80-100bn, depending on the dollar value, and we expect an annual growth of 7-8pc in the usage of flexible packaging films by food companies in the country. We want to work on a complete import substitution by helping and supporting the downstream industry in Pakistan, which can easily be produced locally, saving around $25m annually.” The company offers a diverse portfolio of packaging solutions, producing Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene, Cast Polypropylene, and Biaxially Oriented Poly-Ethylene Terephthalate films. It is the first group in Pakistan to provide one-window flexible packaging solutions. According to him, the flexible film packaging industry in general, and his company in particular, are working extensively to encourage investment in recycling flexible packaging films. Likewise, National Foods’ new manufacturing facility, part of the company’s plan to reduce the nation’s reliance on imported raw materials through its ‘Seed To Table’ initiative launched in partnership with progressive farm-managing companies, will help it cater to the domestic market, significantly increase its export volume, and create over 600 jobs. “We have launched our ‘Seed to Table’ initiative to reduce the country’s dependency on imported raw materials, particularly the annual import of tomato paste amounting to $10m.” He says the tomato project results have exceeded his expectations, and his company intends to double the acreage to 1,000 acres next year. He says the same model will now be replicated with other key ingredients like red chillies, further strengthening domestic agriculture and reducing reliance on imports. Pakistan produces approximately 144,000 tonnes of red chillies annually, yet over 20,000 tonnes have to be imported per year to meet specific industry requirements. “The new production facility is equipped with cutting-edge technology and production capacity of 6000 tonnes/month for production of spices, recipe mixes, ketchup, mayonnaise, Chinese sauces, seasonings and Kasuri Methi,” the company’s global CEO Abrar Hasan told this correspondent at the Pakistan Agriculture Connection Expo & Conference in Lahore. Currently, the food company exports its products to 40 countries across five continents. It has subsidiaries in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and North America and has recently expanded its supply chain to Canada. Regarding hurdles in increasing processed food exports, Abrar Hasan notes that Pakistani companies could not expand their presence in the international export markets because of various issues, including restrictions on their investments abroad.  “Our dilemma is the same one that is being faced by the country: the dollar crunch. Companies must invest abroad to ensure their presence in foreign markets and boost their exports. But the State Bank doesn’t allow you to invest abroad because we do not have dollars for that. “Strangely enough, individuals have greater and freer access to foreign exchange than the corporates. The exporters are allowed to retain 10pc and invest 10pc of their export revenues, and this facility is available only to the existing exporters for setting up their shop outside the country. “This amount is not enough to make your presence felt in the foreign markets. This also means that a new investor who wants to venture into the export market cannot do so because they don’t have foreign exchange,” he says. He believes that the country’s exports cannot increase unless foreign exchange is freely available to companies. “We export our products through distributors sitting in foreign markets. But this model isn’t very successful. If we want to boost our exports and display our products on large supermarkets’ shelves, we need fulfilment centres and warehouses in those markets,” Hasan argues. According to him, the effort to raise exports requires companies like this to invest in raw material supply and the forward distribution chain in foreign markets. “That is the only way of guaranteeing the quality of products according to international standards and ensuring a continuous, uninterrupted supply to the international buyers,” he urges.

96,Tax reforms — easier than expected,"The Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) recent decision to block the mobile SIMs of 506,671 individuals who failed to file their tax returns for 2023 as a penalty is a controversial move that telecom operators may challenge in courts. It is yet another example of using diktat to expand the tax net and improve tax collection instead of introducing systemic reforms based on best international practices. Earlier on April 1, 2024, the FBR initiated a mandatory tax registration scheme for retailers and wholesalers in six major cities. Major commercial cities like Faisalabad, Multan, and Sialkot were conspicuously left out. The FBR gave traders one month to register by April 30. Less than 100 traders reportedly registered during April. The number of retailers/traders is estimated to be around three million in the country. Pakistan has been trying to reform the tax system for decades, but the tax-to-GDP ratio has remained low. Meanwhile, low-income developing countries have made progress, with the average tax-to-GDP ratios increasing by about 3.5 percentage points since the early 1990s to 13.8 per cent in 2020.  The World Bank committed $103m in 2004 to a tax administration reform project. However, according to their website, an independent evaluation rating in 2012 showed the outcome to be unsatisfactory. Another World Bank program with a commitment of $350m was approved in December 2023, but it has also made no progress. Pakistan could increase its tax-to-GDP ratio without foreign assistance via Nadra’s stores of information, and an honest will to improve Tax collections grew by just 4pc in real terms — adjusted for inflation — during five years from FY18 to FY23 at an annual average of just 0.81pc. Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio fell from 10.4pc in 2017-18 to 8.5pc in 2022-23, far below the Asia and Pacific average of 19.8pc. The shocking lack of progress is mystifying for a country that has gone to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) a record number of 24 times and received millions of dollars from the World Bank to reform its tax administration. Is it incompetence, lack of intent, or a combination of both? As a first step toward reforming the tax system, the government should entrust the job of policymaking tax and regulation to a separate body of public finance specialists, and the role of the generalists in the FBR should be limited to execution and operating matters. Many countries have benefited from the experience of East Asian countries and followed their policies. Some key features of successful reform programmes include subjecting the discretionary powers of the tax authorities to legislative oversight and legal checks and balances, reducing the overall number of taxes to a few, and slashing maximum rates, as high rates have historically encouraged tax evasion. Moreover, rebates, exemptions and special treatments are eliminated or reduced, and finally, tax administration is simplified using technology. According to a World Bank study published in 2020, improvements in the tax administration of over a 100 countries were largely driven by technological advances, specifically the implementation of electronic filing and payment systems. In 2004, only 43 economies had an online system for filing and paying taxes. Fifteen years later, more than twice as many did.  Developing countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia started using technology to improve their tax collection as early as 2001, 2002, and 2004, respectively. Pakistan does not need McKinsey to help automate the FBR’s tax collection. The firm, though widely known for its management consulting practice, can hardly claim technology as its core competence. According to reports published by The New York Times, The Economist, and other respected international papers, McKinsey has been involved in numerous corruption scandals, questionable practices, and lawsuits related to insider trading from the United States (US) to South Africa. Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio fell to 8.5pc in 2022-23, far below the Asia and Pacific average of 19.8pc Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) has a wealth of experience and technological expertise to help FBR automate its systems. It can get help, if needed, from technology companies who have experience doing similar projects in other Asian countries. Pakistan needs to introduce an integrated digital system through which records of interest and dividend payments made by financial institutions to companies and individuals would be linked to the tax system. This is a widely followed international norm. To introduce a digital tax regime, the National Tax Number (NTN) should be the same as the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) number of individuals without requiring the individuals to register. NTN/CNIC should be linked to the financial system through technology, as is the practice in the US, UK, Canada, Singapore, and many other countries. At the end of every year, all interest or dividend-paying institutions must communicate the total payment (interest and dividend) made to each recipient, including tax withheld, to the tax authority with the NTN as the reference. To ensure that the financial institutions have correct and valid mailing addresses, over-the-counter delivery of chequebooks or debit cards or any such payment instrument should not be allowed. This delivery must take place through the post. This small but critical detail would ensure that the addresses are correct. Proof of address is now a common requirement of banks worldwide to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. All individuals with income greater than the minimum exemption limit should be required to file tax returns and include the details of interest and dividend payments received from the financial institutions. Since these details would have already been communicated by the financial institutions to the FBR, there would be no question of inaccurate reporting. This single step, if properly implemented, would instantly expand the tax net. All tax assessments and correspondence should be available to the income tax filers online through a central portal maintained by the FBR. The FBR should communicate through post or electronic means, and no physical presence of tax filers should be required except in the event of a legal case. These simple but critical measures can dramatically increase tax collections and reduce corruption. Pakistan has nearly 177m bank accounts and around 165m mobile phone users. There is no reason why Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio cannot be increased to catch up with that of other Asian countries in a matter of a few years. This has been done in so many countries. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, just the will and intention to execute.

97,Wheat’s tricky procurement,"The ongoing protests by farmers against the government’s wheat procurement policy have triggered a debate. Some question why the government persists with a controlled wheat marketing system despite its widespread recognition as a failure, particularly in supporting smallholders, who make up over 90 per cent of the total farmers. It is pertinent to mention that this large-scale procurement, often relying on unsustainable commercial borrowing at high interest, is usually justified in the name of smallholders or national food security, especially when the announced wheat support price exceeds the international price, as in 2024.  Every year, the government’s intervention in wheat procurement begins with announcing the wheat support price. This matter frequently sparks intense controversy, as farmers and the government are often at odds. Farmers always insist on cost-plus support price, as they have no sensible justification or incentive to grow wheat otherwise. Additionally, they compare the financial returns of various crops and make rational choices based on potential profitability. Their cost structure depends on the prices of agricultural inputs such as fertiliser, diesel, electricity, seed, pesticides, and labour. Govt’s inability to set a sustainable wheat support price policy due to the cumbersome and corrupt procurement system harms farmers’ profits and national agricultural productivity The cost of agricultural inputs rises every year, and since farmers sometimes have to buy these inputs over the notified prices — fertiliser is a classic example — they expect support prices to increase proportionally, regardless of international market trends. However, since we live in a global village with frequent trade between countries, any policy discussion would remain incomplete without factoring in the dynamics of global markets. Data from the past 10 years on wheat support prices, corresponding international prices, and the dollar exchange rate on April 1 — the start of the harvest season — reveal that in 2014, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, farmers received lower than the international prices. For instance, on April 1, 2022, the international wheat price was $495 per metric ton, and the dollar exchange rate stood at Rs183.4, which equated to Rs4,287 per 40kg. Yet, the government support price was just Rs2,200. Assuming that farmers kept 50pc of the total national production — 26 million metric tonnes — for their own consumption and as seed for the next crop, with the remaining sold, this amounted to Rs678 billion taken out of farmers’ pockets in a single year due to price disparity. However, there is another side to the story. In 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, Pakistan’s farmers received higher wheat prices than international ones (as of April 1). This was largely due to the PML-N government’s much-criticised policy of artificially capping the dollar exchange rate at about Rs100, which made food imports cheaper — a strategy that could not be sustained over the long term. For example, on April 1, 2016, the international wheat price was $187 per metric ton. With an exchange rate of Rs104.72, this translated to Rs783 per 40 kg, while the government paid Rs1,300 to farmers. Regrettably, during these years, smallholders — those with less than 12 acres of land whose interests are often cited in policy discussions — did not benefit from the support prices due to the cumbersome, sluggish, and corruption-ridden government procurement system. As a result, they had to sell their wheat in the open market at significantly lower prices.  Conversely, in years when international prices were high, government authorities restricted the inter-district movement of wheat. They forcibly lifted wheat stocks from farmers’ houses, disregarding even the sanctity of ‘chadar and char-diwari’. In both scenarios, smallholders ended up disadvantaged, while medium-large farmers with political clout, middlemen, and millers were the ultimate beneficiaries of the procurement system. With a carry-forward of four million metric tons of wheat, mainly due to the import of over 3.2m metric tons just before the new crop’s harvest, coupled with the low procurement targets set by the Federal and Punjab governments, wheat is currently being sold in the grain markets far below the support price almost equal to international prices. The announced support price has become nothing more than a joke. In this context, if the government finds itself unable to procure significant quantities of wheat at the support price due to persistent financial constraints, a potential policy option could be for the government to stop announcing a support price from next year onward and let the wheat market operate based on market dynamics, similar to the rice and maise markets in Pakistan. However, the government could still procure wheat from the private sector to the extent necessary to ensure food security and price stability. To stabilise the domestic wheat market, the government can consider importing wheat or releasing its strategic reserves, with or without subsidies, depending on the situation. The question is: what will farmers do if the government does not announce a support price and international prices also remain low? Since the production cost and, in turn, profitability per 40kg vary from farm to farm depending on crop yield, farmers with lower crop productivity would try to increase their yields, given the significant yield gap between progressive and conventional farmers. Alternatively, they could switch to other alternative crops like canola, mustard, sunflower, chickpeas, and maise. Already, excessive wheat cultivation has limited the acreage available for chickpeas and edible oilseeds, leading to large-scale imports of these crops every year. In conclusion, it makes economic sense to specialise in crops that enable a more efficient allocation of resources at the national level. However, for the proposed policy to succeed, it is imperative that our grain markets and agricultural inputs markets — especially fertilisers — function efficiently and fairly, free from the manipulation of mafias.

98,Beware of distractions,"Once again, it’s that time of the year when almost all school and college-going students gear up for their annual exams. The results of these exams not only evaluate the performance students have shown throughout the year and affect their eligibility for scholarships, but they also decide university placements and careers. Therefore, needless to say, annual exams of different local boards, Cambridge University, or individual schools, hold immense significance in a student’s life. Given their importance, all students aim to struggle day and night to excel in these exams. However, many distractions come in the way of a majority of the students and prevent them from achieving their academic goals. These outwardly appealing distractions are a complete waste of time and, since time is the most precious thing a student can have, one cannot expect to excel in studies unless one lets go of distractions, particularly during the exam season. Let’s have a look at some of the distractions that are an obstacle in the way of achieving academic success. Social media Probably the biggest waste of time and attention in this era is the inappropriate use of the numerous social networking sites and apps — WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, X, SnapChat and what not. Minutes turn into hours as you keep scrolling down, posting and liking stories, commenting on others’ posts, watching the latest trends and sharing the ‘live coverage’ of your whereabouts. This will never end and can never end! There will always be people posting updates at all times of the day, trends will change frequently and your mind will always be occupied with noticing how many people have liked your post and who has accepted your friend request or sent you one. In our surroundings, we witness so many individuals who were once bright students, but their grades came down steadily once they bought mobile phones and became active on social media. A few of them did come to realise their mistake only when it was too late! So, a suggestion for school-going students is not to have their own mobile phone and, if necessary, limit the time spent on social media throughout the year and log out of all social networking sites during exams. Distancing from gadgets is essential for excelling in exams, apart from studying hard.  Games All types of games are meant for recreation, but when excessive time is spent on playing them, they become distractions. Video games should never be preferred over outdoor games. It would be even better to avoid playing video games altogether and instead spend the available time playing football, cricket or doing exercise. This is because video games are not good for health, many of them have violent and disturbing content, and a lot of time and attention is wasted to move to the ‘next level’ of the particular game, making one addicted to playing them. As far as outdoor games are concerned, they must never be stopped completely, even during exams. This is because they are essential for keeping the body and mind healthy. However, students should follow a proper routine during exams — time should be reserved for them and they should only be played during that time. Playing outdoor games throughout the day, even during study time should be avoided. Similarly, ‘tournaments’ of cricket and football should not be encouraged during exams because they require extra time and attention. Concisely, by keeping a balance between study time and time for recreation, health benefits can be achieved and distraction due to games can be avoided. Television Even though social media has replaced the role of television to a great extent, watching the TV remains a distracting activity for students. Drama serials are broadcast round the clock and they are advertised in such a manner that many are tempted to watch them. When one episode ends, there remains a never-ending curiosity to find out what happens in the next one. Therefore, one is tempted to watch the entire drama serial, which is a waste of precious time of students that can be better utilised in studies. The same goes for cricket and football matches, whose matches are played and broadcast now and then. Even the shortest format of a cricket match takes at least four hours to complete. I am sure no student can spare this much time in the days before the final exams. Hence, it would be wise to turn off televisions during exams. Highlights and even live streams of cricket matches will remain available on YouTube for all times to come, and can be watched during holidays. The same goes for the TV dramas. However, the time for final exams will not come again. Their result, once announced, will certainly not be changed! Social life and friends Since every grade and school follows their own exam schedule, not all students have exams at the same time. This can be a distraction because siblings can have exams at different times, leading to some being free and enjoying their days while others are studying hard. The same holds true for friends and cousins. And this can lead to those studying hard becoming distracted by the fun activities of their playmates, and in some cases, being forced to attend activities and parties being held during their exam time. Those who are free from exams should care about not disturbing others who are hard at studies, and should wait to hold any get-together until everyone is free and can participate freely. And the ones studying should firmly let others know that they are not available during a certain period as they need to focus on studies, so they should not be bothered during that time. People who genuinely care will do their best not to divert a student’s attention. Dear students, distractions have existed at all times, in one form or the other. Wise students who did not let the pursuit of these distractions compromise their studies achieved their academic goals and secured their careers. However, those who got caught up in the distractions spoiled their grades, and in turn their careers. Therefore, it is important to avoid the many distractions of student life because this important time, once passed, will not come again!

99,Mailbox," From couch potato to a gardener This is regarding the story “From couch potato to gardener” by Sidra Sozer (YW, March 9). The story shows the importance of being active physically and participating in day-to-day tasks. These days, kids often spend all day sitting and playing games on their phones, instead of moving around. They often use bikes for short distances instead of walking. Such habits make one lazy and lead to health problems like obesity. But if children become physically active, it will ultimately result in their good health. Mohammad Aariz,
Islamabad Struggles of Farzan This is with reference to the story “Struggles of Farzan” by Rasheen Fatima (YW, March 16). Farzan’s story teaches us that working hard and believing in ourselves is important for success. Even though he had trouble with school at first, Farzan kept trying and his grades got much better. This shows us that if we work hard and believe in ourselves, we can do well. The story also shows us how valuable education is and how lucky we are to have it. Overall, Farzan’s story reminds us that with determination and effort, we can reach our goals. Sufian Iftikhar,
Rawalpindi The blessed iftar experience This is regarding the article “The blessed iftar experience” by Shahmeer Asif (YW, March 23). The writer highlighted the true essence of Ramazan and how special and joyful iftar gatherings are during this time. The writer added that how breaking the fast together brings people closer to each other, making them feel connected and caring towards one another. Sharing iftar meals help break down barriers between different groups in society. Ramazan is seen as a time for families and communities to come together, enjoy each other’s company, and make happy memories that will last a long time. Sarmad Ali Muhammad,
Sukkur II I agree with the views of Shahmeer Asif in his article “The blessed iftar experience”. The article showed the true meaning of Ramazan, and especially iftar time, which connects people and society even more strongly. Ramazan teaches us to care for each other and be more spiritual. The article also talked about the messages shared during iftar meals, showing how they connect families and communities. Aman Memon,

100,Advice: Evaluation or competition?," As examinations are approaching, we will soon hear chants of grades and positions all around us in schools and homes. Well, exams are designed to assess the understanding of all that a student has studied throughout the year. Now let’s focus on the terms “understanding” and “year.” The scores and grades of exams are a result of the accumulated efforts that students put into their studies throughout the year. So when parents, teachers and others praise or criticise students, all their struggles and efforts put in from the first day of the term should be taken into account. Unfortunately, adults tend to ignore this fact and it all narrows down to the final exams and its marks. Also, to top it off, we are more concerned about the highest marks, top positions and distinctions, and whoever does not achieve at least one of these, does not even get a fraction of the attention. But why are we wired this way? One of the biggest reasons for competition among students is the greed for attention. And it’s not only high marks that we compete for, in fact competition has become a part of our daily life, involving all aspects. The phenomenon which once existed only in sports is now inculcated in our behaviour. This high-tech world and innovations have made us greedy for more and more materialistic possessions. Ask your parents about how happy they were when they used to get Rs.5 for their pocket money. Now reflect upon yourself and your pocket money, which must be in thousands, but it still isn’t enough, right? Yes, times have changed and we need to be socially active, and for that we need to work hard to build a good image. But that does not really happen by being known for possessing materialistic things, but it happens when one is known as a kind and generous person. Unfortunately, we are still in the process of learning and adopting modern-day teaching that is being practiced around the world. Thus our students are stuck with reading long chapters and writing even longer answers, and that’s the only thing we are marked on. But other things should be assessed too. Stepping into the practical world requires confidence, some soft skills and the conceptual knowledge of relevant subjects. Hence, the next time you are competing against your classmates, do remember to take into account all of your and their skills too. One might be great in writing down answers, but not have good presentation skills. Or, one might be a genius in mathematics, but they might struggle in geography, while there might be students who would be great in music and arts, and would not perform that well in academics. All these situations are fine, because no one has ever been or can ever be perfect. So if you want to have a competition, have it with yourself. Look into your weaknesses and work on them throughout the year so that your result speaks of your hard work. Compare yourself to your older versions to see the growth within you. When parents and teachers start comparing you with your others, remind yourself about your strengths. To all our high achievers, well done! We are proud of you, but to all the readers out there, let’s not forget that each year many students appear for exams, while the ranks are only a few. So, let’s pledge to not compare and compete with others, but instead compete with ourselves to become better versions of ourselves! All the very best! You all will nail it!

101,Disrupting Agriculture’s Fiscal Model,"The Industrial Revolution changed the world when governments began to prioritise industries over agriculture. The process led to rapid economic growth in western Europe, North America and parts of Asia, mainly north Asia. The Industrial Revolution was run on fossil fuels and although it massively improved living standards, it led to an existential crisis in the form of carbon emissions, now totalling over 35 billion tons a year. Humanity is now at a crossroads where we have to heal the planet and, at the same time, develop a sustainable path of economic growth and a system of global governance that will develop markets in parts of the world that were left behind by the Industrial Revolution. The world needs a new and enabling form of capitalism that will rapidly bring in sustainable growth and benefit the agro markets of the developing world. Globally, there are approximately 570 million farms, and they can be largely categorised as those falling in the developed and developing (or underdeveloped) parts of the world. The agriculture sectors in the US and the EU receive massive government funding and subsidies, mainly as direct fiscal transfers to farmers. These countries have smaller populations engaged in agriculture (1.3% and four percent in the US and the EU, respectively), and their governments have ample fiscal space to support and subsidise agro producers. In developing countries, a far larger proportion of their population is engaged in agriculture (in India and Pakistan, over 40% of the respective population is engaged in agriculture, and the figure for rural labour is even higher), and governments do not have the fiscal space to provide support to the people engaged in agriculture. In fact, in much of the developing world, government policies are focused on providing cheap food, mainly by controlling food prices. The consequences of this extractive nature of macroeconomics are manifested by the rural population migrating to urban centres in search of jobs. The challenge is: how can the developing world produce enough food to feed its local population and then have enough to export to developed countries? Globally, we have the technology to gather data on every farm in the world, and in the last two decades, we have acquired two significant tech capabilities: satellite imaging and digital payment systems – they have the potential to transform rural businesses in the developing world. It is this kind of enabling capitalism that is needed in countries like Pakistan, especially in sectors where there is a lack of business and economic opportunities. A Level Playing Field for Rural Businesses
The question is, how to introduce the kind of capitalism that brought rapid development in agriculture in the developed world, and in this respect, the first reality that has to be acknowledged is that stakeholders have to agree that these countries cannot provide the kind of fiscal support richer countries can give their farming community. The best that developing countries can do is provide their farming and rural communities with a level playing field, aided by enabling capitalism. The most obvious step is to stop suppressing food prices. In most developing countries, the availability of cheap food is ensured through different means, but the bottom line remains the same. In India, the government procures food at a minimum price and it is then provided free or at subsidised rates to poorer households, effectively raising the price for the producer. In Pakistan, food prices are suppressed through administrative measures and export controls – sugar is a case in point. Instead, governments should ensure food availability by purchasing the produce at market rates and then providing it to vulnerable households in both rural and urban areas. For example, the US government supports farmers with nearly $50 billion worth of fiscal transfers and subsidies and provides $87 billion to augment the agro produce market. This is an important lesson that our economic policymakers should learn: it is possible to support food producers without suppressing the market for agro produce. Finance for Rural Businesses in the Digital Age
Finance is to business what air is to our lungs, and agricultural and rural businesses in the developing world are starved of competitive sources of finance. In countries where agriculture is massively subsidised, detailed data collection is essential to understanding issues and opportunities. It helps governments respond and support farmers in managing risks and seizing opportunities. In the EU, every farmer receiving a minimum of 200 euros per acre must apply every year, and it is this mechanism that allows governments to gain a full picture of the agricultural sector. In Pakistan, there is a dearth of reliable data for the agriculture sector, and at times, it seems that we are happy to apply faulty data to policy decisions. For example, every year, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) fixes the agro credit target to the tune of trillions of rupees (the current year’s target is Rs 2.250 trillion). However, according to Salim Raza, a former governor of the SBP, agro-lending stands at only three percent of the banking sector’s lending portfolio, while the figure in India is 19% and in Bangladesh it is 21%. So how does one motivate the banks to increase their agro-credit, especially given the sector is vital for Pakistan’s wider economy, as well as being a good market for banks? Experience has shown that banks are the last among stakeholders to extend credit to farms and livestock enterprises because of a fear of agro markets – a fear that is not restricted to Pakistan but is present across the developing world. In Pakistan, bankers fail to differentiate between their fears and legitimate business risks. The result of this mindset is that despite celebrations about ‘achieving agro-credit targets’, institutional sources of finance for farmers in Pakistan are almost non-existent. Policymakers need to look beyond bankers towards alternative sources of finance and tap into peer-to-peer lending options. Peer-to-peer lending has been prevalent in the region for a century and has now gone global, with tech platforms extending this concept on a massive scale. In 2022, Pakistan formalised peer-to-peer lending (rather, they killed it) and the government permitted a maximum limit of rupees one million to a borrower, funded by at least two investors. It was a classic case of how not to do things. As a highly regulated industry, banks need to be disrupted before they are ready to enter the rural finance market as a business opportunity, rather than being coerced by the SBP or because the government has set a target. Livestock and dairy account for over 50% of agriculture’s GDP, yet farm credit data hardly shows up on the credit assets of most bank balance sheets. The consequences of such low financing are reflected in lower farm productivity, with farmers depending on money lenders and arthis for their running finance and asset acquisition needs. Pakistan’s agricultural transformation will not be possible with the kind of mediaeval financing options available to farmers. Agriculture Infrastructure and Climate Change
Infrastructure is a major handicap throttling the transformation of Pakistan’s agriculture sector, and in this context, the irrigation network is the most important. Drainage is the other side of the irrigation coin and functionally does not exist in Pakistan, resulting in salt accumulation in the soil at the rate of one ton per acre per year. The problem is that for most world policy gurus, infrastructure largely means roads, bridges, ports and power stations, and does not include irrigation installations such as barrages and canal networks. Although no formal asset valuation of Pakistan’s irrigation system exists, (comprising three large dams, 19 barrages, 43 main canals, hundreds of branch canals and over a million water courses in the Indus Basin), its asset value must be in the hundreds of trillions of rupees. Given the government’s lack of fiscal space, these assets should be used to raise international finance, including government, private sector and hybrid finance, if Pakistan is to reduce its climate change vulnerability. Despite the rain damage in Sindh and Balochistan and the devastation caused by the 2022 floods, policy planners have done absolutely nothing and we continue to wait for calamities to strike. There is enough evidence to show that borrowing for water in the name of climate change has made matters worse. Both the Left Bank Outfall Drainage (LBOD) and Right Bank Outfall Drainage (RBOD) projects have proved worse than useless. The severity of the 2022 monsoon rains was caused by climate change (as confirmed by Imperial College’s World Weather Attribution), but the damage was exacerbated by faulty irrigation and drainage infrastructure. The Geneva Conference in January 2023 pledged more than what Pakistan requested, yet we have failed to submit quality and investment plans, while we wait for yet another rain disaster. Agro Technology
In Pakistan’s agricultural context, nothing is more important than drainage technology. Tile drainage is a Dutch invention dating to the Middle Ages and is used to control the rise of the subsurface water table caused by supplementary irrigation. In Pakistan, particularly in Sindh, where the groundwater is saline and where options to use groundwater for irrigation and lower the water table are limited, farmlands continue to suffer and efforts have to be made to develop tile drainage commercially. Any sort of meaningful commercial enterprise in irrigated areas will not be sustainable without a salt removal mechanism – in other words, drainage – and it is sad that despite borrowing billions of dollars from international lenders and investing them in public sector entities, Pakistan’s irrigation system is more vulnerable than ever. What is needed is a revamping of the irrigation and drainage technology options, along with smart policies aimed at making the agricultural sector sustainable. In this context, the private sector, mainly fertiliser companies, must enhance its capacity to respond to the needs of Pakistan’s agriculture. If necessary, they can tap concessionary international finance. Technology for Produce Processing
There is a huge need and potential for commodity and agricultural produce processing, based on modern-day financing. Here again, funding has become an almost insurmountable constraint given the lack of understanding by formal (and urban-based) financial houses in Pakistan. China has a $400 billion meat market, from which Pakistani farmers and exporters can benefit. However, the availability of the right technology and funding remains an issue. Marketing of Agro Produce
Marketing agro products is limited since Pakistan faces a hostile neighbourhood. Pakistan has no trade links with India; there is a war-like situation in Afghanistan; and border trade with Iran has almost dried up. Vietnam and Thailand have agro exports worth $53 and $38 billion respectively, due to their free trade agreements (FTA). Pakistan signed an FTA with China in 2006, but the benefits of this have yet to be seen. Pakistan’s foreign policy has to pivot to economic issues if agriculture is to become a source of foreign exchange earnings. All these issues, related to finance, technology, marketing and infrastructure, affect Pakistan’s agricultural productivity and require a thorough understanding of the needs and how to match them to opportunities arising in global markets. This is the single most important challenge. Sadly, agro investment has historically been seen through the lens of aid dollars and executed by unaccountable and agri-illiterate bureaucrats. The time has come to change this. Aijaz Nizamani is a hands-on farmer and agri entrepreneur.

102,Fighting Pakistan’s Growing Food Insecurity Crisis,"The year 2023 ended with a climate conference in Dubai to mark the 28th convening of the Conference of Parties. The meeting was the first Global Stocktake, after the Paris Agreement of 2015, to assess the state of global climate and its impact on present and future life systems on planet Earth. The vision for a universal and liveable planet is not possible without ensuring a sustainable food production and distribution system that is just, equitable and orderly, as well as affordable and accessible to all. Currently, the world is embroiled in a rolling food crisis where 2.4 billion people (nearly a third of humanity) are moderately or severely food insecure, with women and girls bearing the brunt, accounting for almost 60% of the hunger-stricken population. Hunger is on the rise, affecting 800 million people worldwide, with challenges to agricultural productivity also increasing. Each day that delays emission reductions means exposing more people to food insecurity. As the planet continues to warm, food systems will come under increasing stress, setting in motion a chain of events that will reinforce a negative feedback loop. Current farming practices are responsible for a third of all greenhouse gases (GHG). They are also responsible for eroding natural resources (water, soil and pollinator populations) and increasing risks from zoonosis and antimicrobial resistance. Meanwhile, family farms and smallholders (608 million globally) receive a fraction of the sector’s profits. Standing at this critical juncture, it is important to put things into perspective and look for solutions that reduce GHG emissions from the agriculture sector and, at the same time, keep production levels adequate to meet people’s dietary needs. This challenge will require an approach that combines healthy, affordable and sustainable diets with systems in place that tackle food waste, restore natural systems, boost investment in ecologically beneficial and regenerative agriculture practices, and include agroecology as an integral part of managing all future food systems. Farmers need to be rewarded more fairly and their skills harnessed to transform food systems. An equitable approach can help improve livelihoods, tackle environmental degradation and provide food security. However, achieving these outcomes requires a massive uplift in investments from the public and private sectors, including smallholder farmers, who receive only 1.7% of total global climate finance. The world’s biggest emitters of agricultural methane and users of mineral fertilisers should lead by agreeing to cuts in the amount of methane emitted by their farming systems by 2030 and reducing losses of reaction nitrogen by 50% by the same date. Agriculture is hugely dependent on weather patterns and climatic conditions. Crops that rely heavily on seasonal precipitation, specific temperature ranges and soil conditions will be affected more severely by stark variations and sudden changes in the climate. Similarly, heat-sensitive and water-intensive crops will suffer a setback due to sudden changes in factors that determine the quality and quantity of yield. For Pakistan, the challenge is amplified by many other factors that contribute to the emerging crisis. Each has its unique constraints that need to be addressed separately but simultaneously to avoid a polycrisis. The unsustainable population growth rate of 2.55% is the biggest obstacle to food security. It throws a spanner in the attempt to balance supply with demand. In 1981, wheat production in Pakistan was 12 million tons, with a population of 84 million. Today, production is 28 million tons, but an increase in population by 187% (241 million) has rendered the 133% increase in yield redundant. The rampant use of agricultural land without any agroecological studies to guide practices has resulted in suboptimal productivity and the waste of natural resources. Under the ‘business-as-usual’ scenario, low yields will become lower under a changing climate, with serious implications for food security. As a lower-riparian, single-basin country, Pakistan relies heavily on the flows of the River Indus for irrigated agriculture. The quantity and quality of water are both under increasing threat from global warming. The Indus derives over 40% of its water from snow and glacial melt, making its flow more susceptible to climate change. The abundance of water that results from accelerated melting will result in flooding, while water scarcity will lead to drought and desertification. Both are detrimental to agriculture and will contribute to the food crisis. Mountain communities that rely on melted glacier water for agriculture are already witnessing the impact of changes in the timing and quantity of water. As the phenomenon hits country agriculture, the threat to food security will mount. Reports by experts, including modelling projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warn of stark changes in the Hindukush, Himalaya and Karakoram mountains. South Asia warming more rapidly than the rest of the world will put 250 million people who rely directly on the Hindukush, Himalaya and Karakoram mountain system at risk and indirectly impact another 1.8 million. In Pakistan, the increase in population and the decrease in water flow will have serious consequences for food production. Agriculture in arid and semi-arid geographies requires very careful planning to ensure that food systems remain sustainable. Pakistan needs to be mindful and plan carefully. The Country Climate and Development Reports prepared by the World Bank provide a roadmap for transforming the agriculture-food system. The recommendations include delinking agriculture from practices that push water and land resources beyond safe thresholds, causing the degradation of ecosystems across landscapes; managing and equipping irrigation and drainage systems to cope with climate extremes; removing inefficient and inequitable subsidies; improving services essential for increasing productivity – research, extension and the development of markets; and finally, removing impediments such as skewed ownership and tenure insecurity. As we move forward, it is important to connect the dots between food, water and population to create a sustainable model. Maladaptation in agriculture is not a stand-alone issue. It is closely linked to peace, stability and security. The rising cost of food will increase already high rates of stunting in the country, trigger displacements due to climate-induced disasters, result in demographic shifts with enhanced pressure on cities, increase poverty, and create conditions for conflict in society. It is in Pakistan’s interest to take corrective measures before it is too late. The new government has the opportunity to leverage the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) to reform the agriculture and livestock sectors and make them more robust and resilient. Notwithstanding the challenges faced by the agri food sector, it still presents a strong case for catalysing growth in the rural economy and boosting productivity and exports. With calibrated management and the right mix of policies, partnerships and implementation strategies, the agriculture sector offers Pakistan the best opportunity to achieve its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for 2030 and develop the macro-fiscal stability it needs to cope with climate shocks.

103,"“In Pakistan, we have to be patient and take a 20 to 30-year view in terms of getting things right.”","AURORA: Let’s start with a brief overview about your professional background and what Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) does. IMRAN NASRULLAH: My role is regional. I cover South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. I have been involved in the agri-commodity sector for almost 28 years, and in the last 12 years, specifically with corporate farming-related businesses. I don’t claim to be an agri expert, but I certainly have experience in building businesses in multiple geographies. GAR is a very big player in the agri field. We are among the top 10 corporate farmers in the world, and have one of the largest palm plantations in Indonesia. We work with our own corporate farmers, as well as with smallholder farmers across Indonesia. We are very much an agricultural farming-based company. We are one of the largest players in the palm oil space, and we distribute palm products to over 100 countries. Palm oil is very versatile, and goes from cooking oil to renewable fuel to specialty fats, animal feed to oleo-chemicals and specialty chemicals. A: When did GAR enter Pakistan? IN: In 2013, as importers of palm products. By palm products, I mean cooking oil products or palm olein, which is then refined into edible oil. All of the top edible oil players – Dalda, Mezan, Soya Supreme and Sufi – are our customers. They buy the product from us and refine it. We also supply products to make shortening, margarine and biscuit fats; we are working with EBM and CandyLand in that respect. We are also into oleo-chemicals (they go into making soap and shampoo), and about a year ago, we launched our dairy animal feed business. Pakistan is now our hub for animal feed for the region, and we are about to launch in the Middle East using Pakistani resources. A: In Pakistan, do you have an agricultural presence on the ground? IN: No. We do not want to be corporate farmers in Pakistan. We want to work with large-scale corporate farmers and bring them up to speed with the best farming practices we have learned over the years in Indonesia. For example, from an edible oil perspective, canola, soybean, rapeseed and mustard seed are indigenous to Pakistan. They can be grown here and the oil extracted could be a substitute for some of the soybean oil that is being imported. We are keen to see the growth of the oilseed industry in Pakistan as a solution to importing edible oil. When these seeds are crushed, a lot of powder – called meal – is extracted and used in the animal feed industry. A: Do you work with Pakistani cooking oil brands only in terms of supplying the commodity? IN: Yes, none of them are into corporate farming; they are into processing. They buy the oil from us and refine it. A: In which areas do you interact with brands in terms of their corporate farming aspect? IN: In dairy feed. The majority of Pakistan’s large dairy corporate farms are our customers. Last year, we launched a product called GoNutri Energy, which is an ingredient that can be added to animal feed rations to enhance milk fat production for greater yield and quality. The fat content in milk has to be high because it can then be used to make butter. We have dairy experts who work with these farms in an advisory capacity. They are basically veterinary scientists and provide technical advice. A: Why does Pakistan still have one of the lowest dairy yields in the world? IN: Dairy yields in Pakistan are estimated at approximately four to six litres per day compared to the 20 to 30 litres achieved by large corporate farms in Europe and the US, and the feed plays only a small part in the overall picture – basic hygiene, the conditions under which the animals are kept, the amount of water and shade they get – all affect yields. This is why multinational farm managers are working with the top corporate farms in Pakistan to introduce best practices. Pakistani corporate dairy farms are doing better than they used to, but they still have a long way to go. This is about the transition or development of the corporate farm industry in Pakistan. When you have a small farm looking at 800 animals compared to 5,000 animals, the scale changes and the overall conditions for the animals vastly improve. A: Which brands does GAR work with in this respect? IN: We work with Nishat, Sapphire, Dayfresh, Everfresh and Dada Dairies. They then supply to Nestlé, Milkfields, Prema and Goodmilk, among others. A: Has GAR not considered entering the corporate farming space in Pakistan? IN: No, although we have been approached by entities in Pakistan. What we are open to, is sharing what we have learned about sustainable agronomic practices – based on our own experience in Indonesia where we work with 7,000 (our goal is to reach out to 100,000) farmers and teach them best agriculture practices. Corporate farming is a science that is transferable and we can partner in doing this. A: How would you describe the science behind corporate farming? IN: It is about putting processes in place to measure performance, improvements and yields, and for this you need players on the ground working on a day to day basis. Then there is the question of traceability. Customers in the developed world want their food to be traceable and to do this, farmers need to be aware of how it relates to them; the fact that if they produce a product that is traceable, they will be paid better. Corporate farming is also about educating and teaching. How do we look at waste? How do we tackle energy and manage water resources? Indonesia’s challenge, and Pakistan will face the same challenge, is land. Indonesia does not want to cut more trees to grow more palm, so it becomes a question of getting more out of the same land. How do you do that? Is it just fertiliser use? Is it about the technology you adopt? Do you use drones to understand soil conditions? All of these things can be developed as part of the science of corporate farming. A: In your opinion, why is Pakistan’s overall agricultural performance so overwhelmingly subpar? We seem to know the solutions, yet we are unable to implement them. Why? IN: Pakistan’s challenges around low yields and productivity are not unique; we see this everywhere. Farmers’ incomes are not high enough and the younger generations do not want to farm; they would rather go to a large city and become Uber or Careem drivers. We have an ageing farmer population across the globe. Then there is the fact that smallholder farmers are not receiving the scale of inputs and the financing they require; there are middlemen (arthis) who manipulate part of the ecosystem, and at some point, exploit it. There are multiple problems and you cannot tackle all of them at the same time. It is these layers of challenges that make a corporate farming structure essential for a country like Pakistan. Corporate farming can bring about improvements; we have seen it in the dairy sector. It is also happening in the potato sector with Lay’s. Pepsi is working with contract farmers. They give them the seeds and the credit to grow potatoes. Imagine if this were scaled up to corn, wheat, rice, sugar or oilseed. If that were to happen, you would have a sustainable long-term future that integrates smallholders into the bigger picture. Apart from challenges such as water scarcity and land degradation, over-fertilisation is a problem. When you export bananas to the EU, they are rejected because the lead content in our soil is too high. Another challenge is growing the wrong crops. We need a balanced agriculture policy. Corporate farming has brought significant improvements in Indonesia, and it is now a G20 country. In Pakistan, we have to be patient and take a 20 to 30-year view in terms of getting things right. A: What is the difference between contract farming and corporate farming? IN: Contract farmers are individuals and they farm on behalf of a corporate entity. For example, Pepsi did not want to get into farming, so they said, we will help you grow the best potatoes in the world by providing you with the seeds and the financing. There are loads of contract farmers growing potatoes for Pepsi; by the way, the Pakistani potato is now counted among Pepsi’s top potatoes in the world. That is contract farming. Corporate farming is when a company takes on 5,000 acres of land and hires farmers as their employees. In Indonesia, in addition to their own farmers, corporate farms by law have to include a percentage of smallholders, which is a way of bringing people out of poverty – a very progressive way of doing things. It is something that could eventually happen in Pakistan. A: Is the Lay’s potato you are talking about accessible to the ordinary consumer? IN: The scale is too small and upscaling this kind of thing is beyond Pepsi’s capabilities. A: Which means that good quality produce is not available to Pakistani consumers? IN: Yes. However, good quality milk in boxes is available, although only a tiny minority can afford to buy it. The problem is lack of regulation. Legislation needs to come in to ensure better quality food. At the very minimum, if legislation regarding pasteurisation is passed and implemented, there will be an increase in demand for better quality milk, which in turn will increase demand for better quality feed and hence, a cleaner supply chain. Governments need to draft legislation around food safety and standards, and players like ourselves can help because we work with food authorities around the world. That is where things need to go. If proper legislation is enacted in the milk space, the corporate dairy farm sector will skyrocket and they will be able to produce value added products, such as hydrated milk or infant formulas, and export them. Governments need to play their part in terms of legislation and implementation, and then the private sector will come in and take over. The fact that we do not have good quality potatoes is because there are no regulations regarding food quality, and if food quality is not a requirement, why would the farmer invest in producing it for the mass market? A: Is this lack of regulation due to apathy or vested interests? IN: I don’t want to get into a political debate, but agriculture is no different from any other sector in Pakistan. As to whether it is vested interests or apathy, I would say that it is a combination of multiple things. Today, two-thirds of the population is food insecure. Had measures been taken earlier, we would not be in this situation. We would not be massively importing food or, at the very least, we would be exporting food that we can produce well and not importing food we can produce ourselves. A: Is GAR involved in any other agriculture related areas apart from palm oil and dairy feed? IN: We also do sugar. We trade about a million tons of sugar. We bought sugar last year from Pakistan and traded it to West Africa. However, Pakistan’s sugar crop is inconsistent and fraught with its own challenges due to government regulations and other issues, so it is not a consistent export. One also has to keep in mind that Pakistan’s water resources are scarce and sugar is a huge water consumer. We are also working with some oleo-chemical players on the production of soap and shampoo in Pakistan. We are also working with top-quality Pakistani food companies. Companies like CandyLand, EBM and Young’s are trying to innovate in terms of their product quality. We work with global accounts such as McDonald’s, Krispy Kreme and Pizza Hut to develop recipes for better quality products and we are trying to build that skill in Pakistan. A: With brands like EBM or CandyLand are you just supplying a product or is there more to it? IN: We are certainly supplying product, but we are also having broader conversations with brands in terms of an urban population that is becoming more conscious about food safety and standards. There are 30 million people in Karachi and both housewives and younger generations are asking for better quality food. So brands are asking us questions about how they can make their products better and this is where our expertise becomes relevant. There is a huge opportunity to work with brands to make their product better in terms of taste and nutrition. This is what differentiates us from many of our competitors who just sell product. We have an innovation centre in Jakarta where our chefs are developing better quality products with better flavours and taste. One of our dreams is to have a similar centre in the region, maybe Dubai. A lot more Pakistani companies are participating in Gulfood Dubai. A: Is Pakistan putting the right emphasis on training top quality nutritionists and food scientists? IN: There is a lot of potential in Pakistan, but we are not producing the right level of talent systematically. The private sector are training people for their own needs and sending them abroad. It goes back to the question of regulation and legislation. If there is no demand for good quality food, you are not going to have a demand for qualified food scientists; they would rather go to Dubai or elsewhere, because the environment in Pakistan doesn’t exist. There has to be an ecosystem to absorb that talent. A: Does Pakistan have the rudiments necessary to create an ecosystem that prioritises food safety and standards? IN: I don’t think there is an ecosystem per se, although I see islands. My hope is that these islands connect and become a big landmass. Imran J. Nasrullah was in conversation with Mariam Ali Baig.
