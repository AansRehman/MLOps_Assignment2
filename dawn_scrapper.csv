"No such thing as strategic state-owned enterprises, says Finance Minister Aurangzeb","Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Sunday said that there was “no such thing” as strategic state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as he stressed the need for privatisation. He made the remarks at a pre-budget conference in Lahore, two days after  Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the government would limit its business only to strategic and essential SOEs under its domain but their number would be reduced from 40 after scrutiny. Chairing the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) meeting, which was attended by the finance minister, Dar said privatisation of loss-making SOEs would be a priority. The meeting noted that 40 SOEs were currently categorised as strategic or essential, but respective ministries would submit their details to the Cabinet Committee on State-Owned Enterprises (CCoSOE). The CCoSOE will determine the status of the SOEs to be categorised as strategic or essential entities. Speaking on Sunday, Aurangzeb said: “There is no such as [a] strategic SOE.” Talking about the meeting chaired by Dar on Friday, he continued, “We are absolutely on the same wavelength — that there is no such thing as a strategic SOE.” The finance minister said that a meeting would be held tomorrow where “we will go back to various ministries and say that all this should be handed over to the private sector”. “There will be public-private partnership and we will accelerate the privatisation agenda,” he said. Commenting on concerns regarding the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Aurangzeb said the government was not just looking at foreign investors. “They are local and foreign investors who are bidding […] there is no such thing that we are only looking at foreign investors,” he said. Commenting on a fresh loan programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, he said that a larger and longer programme was needed to bring “permanence in macroeconomic stability and structural reforms”. He also talked about energy reforms, saying that there were “leakages” and stressed the need for stopping theft. He said that changes were being brought to the boards of distribution companies (Discos) in order to bring in those from the private sector for “better corporate governance”. “And then you will see how we bring those Discos towards concessions or privatisation or a combination of both,” he emphasised.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1833050/no-such-thing-as-strategic-state-owned-enterprises-says-finance-minister-aurangzeb
IMF mission to meet Pakistani authorities next week to discuss ‘next phase of engagement’: official,"An International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission will meet Pakistani authorities next week to discuss the “next phase of engagement”, an official from the international money lender said on Sunday. Speaking to Dawn.com, Esther Perez Ruiz, the Fund’s resident representative for Pakistan, said: “A mission team led by Nathan Porter, IMF’s mission chief to Pakistan, will meet with authorities next week to discuss the next phase of engagement. “The aim is to lay the foundation for better governance and stronger, more inclusive, and resilient economic growth that will benefit all Pakistanis,” she added. Pakistan last month completed a short-term $3 billion programme, which helped stave off sovereign default, but the government has stressed the need for a fresh, longer-term programme. Last week, the Fund said that a mission was expected to visit Pakistan this month to “discuss the FY25 budget, policies, and reforms under a potential new programme for the welfare of all Pakistanis”. Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the $350bn economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high 38pc last May. The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around 2pc this year compared to negative growth last year. Pakistan is expected to seek at least $6bn and request additional financing from the Fund under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust. On Friday, the Fund said that downside risks for the economy remain exceptionally high. “Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” said the IMF in its staff report following the second and final review under the standby agreement. The Fund added that political complexities and high cost of living could weigh on policy, adding that policy slippages, together with lower external financing, could undermine the narrow path to debt sustainability and place pressure on the exchange rate. The IMF also said higher commodity prices and disruptions to shipping, or tighter global financial conditions, would also adversely affect external stability for the cash-strapped nation. The fund stressed the need for timely post-programme external financing disbursements.

Situation in AJK calms down after 2 days of violent clashes,"Following violent clashes over the last 48 hours, which left a policeman dead, the situation in Muzaffarabad seemed to have calmed down on Sunday, with a Rangers detachment that was sent to Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) from Kohala having been withdrawn. AJK witnessed violent clashes between the police and activists of a rights movement amid a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across the territory on Friday and Saturday, which left at least one police official dead and more than 90 others injured, officials told Dawn.com on Saturday. Mirpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kamran Ali had said that Sub-inspector Adnan Qureshi succumbed to a gunshot wound in the chest in the town of Islamgarh, where he was deployed to stop a rally for Muzaffarabad under the banner of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC). The JAAC, which has traders at the forefront in most parts of the state, has been seeking the provision of electricity as per hydropower generation cost in AJK, subsidised wheat flour and an end to the privileges of the elite class. They called for the strike following the arrest of at least 70 of their members in raids on Thursday. Reports emerged in the wake of the protests on Sunday that three Rangers battalions had entered the territory through Kohala and were awaiting further orders. However, AJK Minister for Rural Development Faisal Mumtaz Rathore confirmed that the Rangers, due to the intervention of President Asif Zardari, were “called back as soon as they entered Azad Kashmir” since the situation had calmed down. Meanwhile, in Islamabad, former prime minister of AJK Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi slammed the deployment, calling it a “drama” and an attempt to score political points. “First they send them, then call them back, what is this?” the ex-AJK PM said. “Those fighting for their rights and engaging in protest are free to do so, but they must remain peaceful,” Niazi said in a press conference. He added that they (the protestors) must not give the “enemy” a chance to sow discord within the territory and create infighting. In a post on Facebook, Rathore acknowledged the public demands for cheap electricity, but admitted that addressing them was “out of his hands”. “The big demand of the people, the demand for cheap electricity and the end of loadshedding, falls under the jurisdiction of the Government of Pakistan,” Rathore said. Urging the public to remain peaceful, he said, “In this one year [I have been in office], I have never been against the right to peaceful protest and [never] supported violence against people.” In the aftermath of the protests, JAAC leader Shaukat Nawaz Mir reiterated that the committee is a peaceful organisation and willing to negotiate with the authorities to ensure the provision of cheap electricity and cheap flour. He also appreciated the withdrawal of the Rangers from the area. “We have planned another shutter-down strike,” he told reporters on Sunday. “We have been peaceful for the last year and always will be a peaceful movement. This territory and its institutions and police are our own.” Mir maintained that the JAAC is advocating for the rights of the public in AJK, “but it is the bureaucrats who do not understand the public’s needs that are doing the damage”. The JAAC is peaceful and open to negotiations, Mir added, requesting to be notified by the authorities about decisions taken. “We do not want to hurt anyone.” He also slammed the federal government for not cutting down spending while at the same time claiming they have no room in the budget to subsidise electricity or flour. “The government claims they can’t provide cheap electricity and flour because they have no budget, but they have the money for watches and cars,” Mir said, adding that the federal government and the prime minister should be “ashamed”. “I don’t want my forum to be controversial,” Mir said. “We are made up of respectable politicians … the local council is standing with us”. The JAAC leader added that the movement was successful since members of multiple parties and councils “are on our side”. “Our nation is conscious now. There is no politics here, we just want our rights and identity.”",https://www.dawn.com/news/1833056/situation-in-ajk-calms-down-after-2-days-of-violent-clashes
"Fight till the last ball, PCB chief tells cricket team in Dublin","Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Sunday told the national team to “fight till the last ball” ahead of the second match of a three-match T20 series against Ireland. As he met players of the men’s national team in the Irish capital of Dublin, the PCB quoted him as saying: “Fight till the last ball; the competition should be apparent.”  On Friday, Ireland recorded their maiden T20 win against Pakistan who could not defend a solid-looking 182-5 after being put in to bat first, dealing a shocking blow to the Babar Azam-led side’s preparations for the World Cup, which is taking place next month in the United States. The loss to Ireland, who are in Pakistan’s group in the T20 World Cup, came after a series draw on home soil to a New Zealand squad missing most of their first-choice players. With Babar only recently reinstated as captain, it was another bump in the road for their tournament preparation.  Today’s match will start at 7pm, with Ireland leading the series by 1-0. In a post on X, the PCB shared a video of Naqvi meeting the Green Shirts and speaking to them, adding that a detailed discussion on the action plan took place during the two-hour-long meetup. Encouraging the team, the PCB chairman urged the players to play with hard work, passion and a “professional approach”. He noted that T20 cricket needed a unique and aggressive approach, adding that victory was only possible if cricket was played in a “modern manner”. “An action plan can be formulated while sitting in a room but the real test is on the ground, where the performance should be visible,” the PCB quoted him as telling the team. Naqvi praised all players as “undoubtedly talented, professional and the best”, adding that the team’s bowling attack was “splendid”. However, he emphasised that great attention was required when fielding so that the opponent “cannot get any chance” to score. “The players are the hope for Pakistan and you have to meet the nation’s expectations. Teamwork is the fundamental thing for victory,” the PCB chairman said. He noted that the public loved cricket and had expectations from the team. Naqvi said that success would come if all 11 of the players in the team performed with unity. “No one is accepting the loss in the first match against Ireland. The real test after Ireland and England is the World Cup,” he added.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1833052/fight-till-the-last-ball-pcb-chief-tells-cricket-team-in-dublin

Canada arrests fourth Indian national in killing of Sikh activist,"A fourth Indian national was charged by Canadian authorities on Saturday in the 2023 killing of a separatist Sikh leader in Vancouver. Amandeep Singh, 22, was already being held for unrelated gun charges before being charged with “first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder” in the slaying of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Three other Indian nationals were arrested this month. The killing sparked a diplomatic row between Ottawa and New Delhi when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau linked Indian intelligence to the killing. Nijjar — who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 — had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India. He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged “terrorism” and conspiracy to commit murder — allegations he denied. He was shot dead on June 18, 2023, by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver. Trudeau announced several months later that Canada had “credible allegations” connecting Indian intelligence to the slaying. India dismissed the allegations as “absurd” and responded furiously, briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats. In November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil. Prosecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning. The shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against China’s growing influence. US intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India’s top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, the Washington Post reported in April. Canada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two per cent of the country’s population, with a vocal minority calling for an independent state of Khalistan.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1833042/canada-arrests-fourth-indian-national-in-killing-of-sikh-activist
Second night of auroras seen amid ‘extreme’ solar storm,"Auroras lit up skies across swaths of the planet for the second night in a row on Saturday, after already dazzling Earthlings from the United States to Tasmania to the Bahamas the day before. A powerful solar storm — which could continue into Sunday — has triggered spectacular celestial shows usually confined to the far northern reaches of the planet, hence their nickname of the “northern lights”. “I have the sensation of living through a historic night in France […] It was really charged, with solar particles and emotions,” Eric Lagadec, an astrophysicist at the Observatoire de Cote d’Azur, wrote on social media after the first night. “Find good spots, away from the lights, with a clear view to the north!” Late on Saturday evening, pictures again started trickling onto social media as people in the United States reported sightings, though not as strong as Friday night’s. The first of several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — expulsions of plasma and magnetic fields from the Sun —  came just after 4pm GMT on Friday, according to the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). It was later upgraded to an “extreme” geomagnetic storm —  the first since the “Halloween Storms” of October 2003 that caused blackouts in Sweden and damaged power infrastructure in South Africa. Friday’s storm was listed as hitting level five geomagnetic conditions — the highest on the scale. Saturday saw G3 to G5 conditions, with G4 or higher conditions predicted Sunday and G3 conditions possible into Monday. But no major disruptions to power or communications networks appear to have been reported this time around, despite initial worries from authorities. There have only been “preliminary reports of power grid irregularities, degradation to high-frequency communications, GPS and possibly satellite navigation,” the SWPC said. Elon Musk, whose Starlink satellite internet operator has some 5,000 satellites in low Earth orbit, said his satellites were “under a lot of pressure, but holding up so far”. However China’s National Centre for Space Weather issued a “red alert” on Saturday morning, warning the storm will impact communications and navigation in most areas of the country, state news agency Xinhua reported. Auroras were visible in the northern half of the country, according to media reports. Excitement over the phenomenon —  and otherworldly photos of pink, green and purple night skies —  popped up across the world, from Mont Saint-Michel on the French coast to Payette, Idaho — in the western United States — to Australia’s island state of Tasmania. People pose for photos as a geomagnetic storm lights up the night sky above the Bonneville Salt Flats on May 10 in Wendover, Utah. — AFP Unlike solar flares, which travel at the speed of light and reach Earth in around eight minutes, CMEs travel at a more sedate pace, with officials putting the current average at 800 kilometres per second. The CMEs emanated from a massive sunspot cluster that is 17 times wider than our planet. People with eclipse glasses can also look for the sunspot cluster during the day. The Sun is approaching the peak of an 11-year cycle that brings heightened activity. NOAA’s Brent Gordon encouraged the public to try to capture the night sky with phone cameras even if they couldn’t see auroras with their naked eyes. “You’d be amazed at what you see in that picture versus what you see with your eyes.” Fluctuating magnetic fields associated with geomagnetic storms induce currents in long wires, including power lines, which can potentially lead to blackouts. Long pipelines can also become electrified, leading to engineering problems. Spacecraft are also at risk from high doses of radiation, although the atmosphere prevents this from reaching Earth. NASA has a dedicated team looking into astronaut safety and can ask astronauts on the International Space Station to move to places within the outpost that are better shielded. Even pigeons and other species that have internal biological compasses could be affected. Pigeon handlers have noted a reduction in birds coming home during geomagnetic storms, according to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The most powerful geomagnetic storm in recorded history, known as the Carrington Event after British astronomer Richard Carrington, occurred in September 1859.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1833046/second-night-of-auroras-seen-amid-extreme-solar-storm
ADB links support with IMF’s clean chit," “Given my interactions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the dialogue decisiveness of the current government, I feel very hopeful that there will be a successor programme from the Fund,” said the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) Country Director for Pakistan Yong Ye in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of ADB’s 57th Annual Meeting in Tbilisi this week. Tacitly indicating that support from ADB would only be possible with a clean chit from the Fund, Mr Ye expressed cautious optimism for the economy. Highlighting the uncertainties from last year, Mr Ye termed the IMF agreement announced in June as a ‘miracle’. Since then, however, he said, the caretaker government did a good job stabilising the economy under the Fund’s Stand-By Arrangement. More importantly, he added, with the IMF agreement in place, the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased from $4.4 billion to over $9bn in the week ending on May 3. “While the country may still be in the ICU, its immediate liquidity crisis has been sorted, and default has been avoided. This has given some confidence to the markets,” he said. Record highs of PSX Commenting on the frequent new highs of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Mr Ye observed that previously, when the eurobond payment was due, there had been a lot of hype in the media with speculations about whether the country would be able to repay or default. “Such pieces did not induce courage and the markets started fluctuating, contributing to a fluctuating exchange rate.” Bank’s top official says Pakistan has sorted out immediate liquidity crisis, but still in ICU This time around, in April, when the $1bn eurobond payment was due, it was paid without fanfare, indicating much better market confidence. Other positive indicators, such as a narrowing external account deficit and recovering remittances, have also improved investor confidence. However, fiscal deficit challenges remain. One major reason behind them is the high interest rate and high debt servicing burden. ‘Act on what you know’ “In my first meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, he showed his commitment to implementing and acting on reforms,” said Mr Ye. Pakistan does not need more economic prescriptions, he said, agreeing with the finance minister’s recent statements. He said the general perception is that Pakistan knows what it needs to do but never does it. “Act on what you know needs to be done.” He emphasised that the ADB management wants to be with the government in this difficult time. The agency understands the need to ensure that the debt is sustainable rather than an added burden that does not remove the constraints the country is facing. While the economy is recovering, there is still uncertainty moving forward. The removal of this uncertainty depends very much on the government’s commitment and ability to implement economic and structural reforms. A special arrangement Mr Ye emphasised the importance of investment in reviving the economy and the role the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) could play. “My understanding of SIFC is that it is a special arrangement to attract foreign direct investment from some targeted countries,” he said. From the ADB’s point of view, while the SIFC may be a quick short-term solution, Pakistan still needs to look for long-term systematic solutions to attract foreign direct investment. This would require an overall enabling environment with improved regulations and transparency. Given past unsuccessful incidents such as Reko Diq, SIFC, at least in the short run, can demonstrate the country’s potential and ability for investment, which can then be further broadened for other countries. An important element in attracting FDI is the ability of firms to repatriate profit out of the country. At the moment, investors may believe that while earning money in Pakistan is possible, repatriating profits is challenging. Non-productivity of real estate The country needs to increase its revenue and rationalise expenditures, Mr Ye remarked. As an example, he highlights the real estate sector where a lot of savings are invested. The real estate sector is “just financial addition with no value addition. If the country invests in its natural resources instead, the country will start rolling,” he said. Inflation is on a downward trend, and if this trend continues, the monetary policy rate will come down, Mr Ye opinioned, resulting in a smaller burden of debt servicing and more fiscal room. This will also unlock the investment and borrowing by the private sector, he hoped. Since there is a lot of pent-up investment demand during the period of high interest rates, Pakistan may enter into a boom cycle when the rates start coming down. But for the revival to be sustainable, ‘it all comes back to reforms’,’ he said. Remaining pledges While ADB was among the institutions that pledged support after the disastrous floods of 2022, almost the entire amount has yet to be disbursed. ADB had pledged about $1.5bn, of which only $108.79 million has been released according to a media report, with a further $340.9m expected this year. In response to why there has been a delay, Mr Ye said that the amount pledged was for reconstruction and that the process cannot be rushed. “The damages have to be assessed along with the ground realities, keeping in mind the new climate risk profile and the possibility that these areas may be flooded again,” he said. Pointing out that water was still standing in some areas till the start of this year, Mr Ye said that the new climate risk profile needs to be assessed before the feasibility study. Some roads need to be redesigned, followed by the procurement process, contract award, and finally, disbursement. The entire process is lengthy. Mr Ye identified several critical areas for Pakistan’s long-term economic growth. These include controlling inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and diversifying the export base.

Govt hints at raising wheat purchase target,"• Drive to buy 400,000 tonnes of grain kicks off; farmers want wheat procured from across Punjab
• Kissan leader urges govt to ensure official rate of staple, terms proposed subsidy a pittance LAHORE: The Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited (Passco) on Saturday began its second phase of wheat procurement from Faisa­labad in line with a decision of the federal government to procure 400,000 tonnes more than the original target of 1.4 million tonnes. As he kick-started the second phase, Food Minister Rana Tanveer hinted at the possibility of further increasing the target to facilitate farmers. Passco had originally aimed to purchase 1.4m tonnes, but after farmers started protesting, the pressure on the federal and provincial governments piled on and the premier decided to increase the target to 1.8m tonnes. As of now, Passco has achieved 98 per cent of the initial target and distribution of gunny bags is already underway to meet the increased target. Farmers, however, are not happy with the government’s decision to procure slightly more wheat than intended. They said Passco — a federal body — operated in 13 out of 97 tehsils in Punjab and the decision to purchase additional wheat from designated areas would have a negligible impact. According to farmers, the tradeable surplus this year is expected to be about 10m tonnes and buying 400,000 tonnes would hardly make any difference. Punjab, on the other hand, is reluctant to procure wheat from growers despite province-wide agitations and the persistent stance of farmers. This has also caused a significant impact on the price of wheat, with the staple being sold at a rate much lower than the official price of Rs3,900 per 40kg. The Pakistan Kissan Ittehad claimed that farmers had lost Rs1,150 billion under the wheat head alone due to the crashing prices which reportedly dipped below Rs3,000 per 40kg. Instead of procurement, the Punjab government said it would compensate farmers with interest-free loans of Rs150bn. Kissan leader Khalid Mahmood Khokar, however, is not impressed, saying the paltry subsidy came at a cost of Rs1,150bn. “Instead of this gimmickry, please ensure an officially declared price, which the provincial government had itself calculated, announced, and promised,” Mr Khalid urged the Punjab government. The crisis Pakistan is going through the most difficult wheat season of its history, exacerbated by policy failure and the import of millions of tonnes of wheat shortly before the bumper harvest. The bumper crop followed a record import of 3.5m tonnes by the private sector allegedly due to the ‘weakness’ of the caretaker regime.  Against the backdrop of such a huge import, hoarders also released their stock to earn profit. The releases of stock by the hoarders and the import of the commodity flooded the market and even met the “entire domestic requirement”, leaving Passco and the Punjab Food Department with 4m tonnes of unexhausted stock. “The 3.5m tonnes imports were staggered in a way, in the name of sustained supplies, that it overlapped with domestic harvesting season and created havoc for the domestic market,” explained Muhammad Ramzan, a wheat trader from Lahore. At the start of this month, the Punjab government had promised a probe into the wheat scandal against the backdrop of protests by the farmers. On Friday, the farmers resumed their protests from Multan against the provincial government’s decision to not buy wheat from farmers. At the protest, PKI leader Khokhar had said the agitation would continue against the government in every district of the province till the acceptance of their demands. He had said the federal government was procuring the wheat in 16 tehsils of the province, while the Punjab government had not purchased even a single grain so far. “Federal government should also buy wheat from other tehsils of the province,” he had demanded.

"KP governor, CM Gandapur exchange threats in acrid spat","PESHAWAR / DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The acrimony between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur and Governor Faisal Karim Kundi intensified on Saturday when the two leaders threatened each other with “dire consequences”. A day after the governor’s fiery speech, Chief Minister Gandapur warned Governor Kundi to stay within the limits of his constitutional position and avoid making olitical statements. After appearing in an anti-terrorism court in connection with the murder of former KP law minister Sardar Israrullah Khan Gandapur, the CM who belongs to the PTI said he could use his powers to banish Mr Kundi from Governor House. “This Governor House is not your property. Don’t force me to … turn it into a museum and open it for the public.”  “I will shift you to a two-room annexe,” said Mr Gandapur. He went on to say that even fuel for the governor’s official vehicles comes from the budget of the provincial government and threatened to stop it if the governor who belongs to PPP didn’t refrain from “political statements, below-the-belt remarks and confrontation”. Gandapur warns Kundi will be banished from official residence for indulging in politics, confrontation “You’re the governor; politics is not your job,” Mr Gandapur warned, calling himself the elected representative who came to power with the voters’ mandate. The CM added that if the governor did not pay heed to his “warning”, he would seek his removal. “[T]he letter which notified you [as governor] will also denotify you.” In a hard-hitting speech on Friday, Governor Kundi had indirectly accused the CM of being involved in the killing of former law minister Mr Israrullah and ANP leader Umar Khattab Sherani.  Mr Israrullah was killed in a suicide attack in his hometown of Kulachi near Dera Ismail Khan in October 2013. While government officials blamed the Wazi­ris­tan-based Gandapur group for the bombing, a little-known shadowy group, Ansar­­ul Mujahideen, claimed responsibility. ANP’s Mr Sherani was murdered in December 2021, a day before the province’s local government elections, which he was contesting as a candidate for the post of D.I. Khan mayor. The governor said that if he relinquished his constitutional post, he would prove to be a bigger nemesis for CM Gandapur. Mr Kundi also warned that protecting the Governor House was “his constitutional duty” and whoever tried to occupy it “would be dragged on roads”. This was an apparent reply to Mr Gandapur’s May 9 statement in which he warned against efforts to impose governor’s rule in KP and said PTI activists would occupy the Governor House. ‘Want good ties with CM’ Meanwhile, in conversation with Dawn, Mr Kundi said he hoped for good relations with the chief minister, but whoever talked about occupying the Governor House “will be answered befittingly”. People of KP shouldn’t suffer in the fight between the prime minister, governor and chief minister, he said, advising the provincial government to improve the law and order situation. He recalled the kidnapping of a sessions judge in Tank last month and claimed the chief minister paid extortion money for his release. Expected animosity The acrimonious relationship between the two leaders — both being bitter political rivals hailing from D.I.Khan — was expected since Mr Kundi was nominated for the post by his party’s chairman, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. The CM expressed his disapproval of the appointment by not attending  Mr Kundi’s oath-taking ceremony last Saturday. A few days later, on May 8, the governor KP did not sign a summary moved by the provincial government to convene an assembly session, forcing the provincial government to requisition the session through the speaker to present the current fiscal budget, according to sources.

Footprints: the day the city of Karachi went berserk,"This article was originally published on May 12, 2017 KARACHI: Attempt after attempt fails to elicit comments from direct witnesses to the carnage that took place in Karachi on May 12 ten years ago. All these men served as judges in the country’s high courts and the apex court before they retired to re-join the legal fraternity as seasoned practitioners of the law. For each of my requests, I receive either “excuse me”, or “sorry”. Finally, one of them agrees to talk — but not openly. “Please don’t mention my name,” says the retired Sindh High Court judge as our conversation ends. “You may write each and every word I have shared with you but not my name. I would prefer to be an anonymous source. One never knows here what can happen the next day: it’s better to stay away from even the memories of such controversial events.” The ordeal he recalls of that bloody Saturday refreshes the grim memories of the city being under siege for nearly 24 hours, held hostage by forces in the face of whom even jurists and law-enforcers were helpless. Two rival rallies had been planned that day — one by the legal fraternity, backed by parties then in the opposition, to welcome into the city the then deposed chief justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, and the other organised by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), favoured by the then military dictator General Pervez Musharraf, in protest against the “politicisation” of the issue of the presidential reference against Mr Chaudhry. A certain level of fear had prevailed, but no one could have guessed the deeply disturbing events that were to follow — certainly not the then serving high court judge. “I was travelling with my driver and armed guard to the Sindh High Court where the chief justice had to deliver an address when we were forced to stop near Sir Syed Girls College in Nazimabad,” he says. Armed motorcyclists surrounded his official, flag-bearing car, pulled out his driver and switched off its engine, seizing the keys. The bikers then bludgeoned the stationary car several times, so hard that its bumper fell off. In one of the busiest and most densely populated city neighbourhoods, a serving judge sat in fear. “I talked to them,” he says. “They were obviously aware that I was a high court judge. After debate and argument, they allowed me to leave but I reminded them that I couldn’t because keys of my car had been snatched by one of them.” Finally, the key was returned and the judge was ‘allowed’ to leave. As he got back into his car, the men surrounding him came up with their last strike: they stripped his car of the national flag. At the nearest police station of Pak Colony, he waited for nearly two hours for police security to arrive, as promised by the Governor’s House after it was informed about the episode. “Then came an SSP-ranking officer with his team to escort me,” he says. “The police left us some two kilometres from the Singh High Court building, saying that they could no longer help us. My driver parked the car at a safer place. Then, with my driver and guard, I walked to the high court to find all entrances blocked. Finally, I jumped over one of the walls to enter the building.” If this was the experience of a high court judge, one can only imagine the situation for political workers. In anticipation of the two rallies, law enforcers had been put on high alert the day before. The fire brigade had been directed to remain on standby and hospitals were asked to ready themselves. But the next day, hapless citizens found that the city had been abandoned by the law-enforcement agencies, and armed youths were wandering at will. Nasir Khan, one of the Awami National Party workers, witnessed a few of them at Malir Halt. I meet Nasir almost at the same spot where he narrowly escaped death. “As our rally from Quaidabad reached here [Malir Halt], it came under fire,” he says. “I miraculously remained unhurt but I watched two of my friends die from bullet wounds and several others fell injured. It was a terrible experience and even today I shiver while recalling that day.” After 10 years, only eyewitness accounts of the May 12 events remain. Justice and any action on the part of the state are still awaited. “Should we call ourselves humanity when the fallen remain un-avenged a year to a day since that fateful day in May?” wrote Justice Qazi Faez Isa, a Supreme Court judge and former chief justice of the Balochistan High Court, in this paper in 2008. Years later, the question remains pertinent. Published in Dawn, May 12th, 2017",https://www.dawn.com/news/1332592
Mother’s Day: Reflections of a mother,"This piece was originally published in Dawn, Young World on May 9, 2020. Spending sleepless nights while tending to children, feeding them, changing diapers, etc. are a part of life of every mother having infants. When the infants grow up a little, the next phase is to educate them, teach them manners and make them learn to be a part of the world out there. It is tough to do all that for me, like every other mother. After all it is not all I have to do. One has to focus on one’s career and household chores at the same time, and fulfil one’s duties towards other family members. Did I mention a “me-time” somewhere in all that I said? I guess not. There is no mentioning of it simply because there is no time left for me while doing all that I do. It is said that you learn about the true value of parents once you have children of your own. I have found this to be exactly true. The sacrifices and unconditional love it takes to be a mother has certainly made me realise the sacrifices my mother made in bringing me up. Looking back at my life, I wish I could change all those moments in my life when, as a child, I misbehaved with my mother. I also wish that I had spent more time with her and made life easier for her. As my children grow up, they seem to become less obedient and respectful. This really hurts. I see this as a general trend in all the children, nowadays. With some exceptions, the older they get, the less respect they show to their mother and elders in general. Having a mind of one’s own is fine, but there cannot be any excuse for bad behaviour towards one’s mother. And also just because your mother is less strict and more friendly than your father, it should not lead you to not show respect to her. Mothers like me do not want our children to be our puppets. All we ask for is recognition of our love and efforts. Expecting respectfulness is a part of that recognition. Every mother would love her child to come up to her and, as a minimum, thank her for her efforts. It would be great if the child could offer to help her in little ways. If nothing else, they should at least not leave any mess for the mother to clean up! Mother’s Day is important, but it is more than just a special day. It is really a reminder that mothers deserve our respect and recognition for their love at all times. For a child to have this realisation certainly means more to mothers than having a card or flowers on Mother’s Day. This is because it means that this realisation would translate into care and respect for one’s mother. For my part, I have started taking care of my mother in all the ways I can. While I do not live with her, I try my best to stay in touch or visit her as much as I can. Taking care of her health and what she wants has become very important for me. It does not matter to me what others do or say about taking care of their mothers. All that matters is what my mother deserves. And that exactly is my message to you all! Do not look at what others do, think of what you can do for your mother, who deserves all the love and respect that one can. Mothers can be your friends too if you learn to share things with her. It is just a misunderstanding that they would not understand you or what you want. You can talk about anything with her: sports, cartoons, TV shows, super heroes, general knowledge, etc. You would be pleasantly surprised when you do end up confiding in her or discussing things with her. I am lucky that I get cards and flowers from my family on Mother’s Day. But many things remain left to be desired on the other 364 days of the year. Still whatever my children do the rest of the year, I would never stop caring for and loving them. I guess that’s what the motherhood is all about. Happy Mother’s Day everyone, but make every day Mother’s Day, for she never fails to make everyday special for her children.

Indian elections,"THE Islamophobic rhetoric being employed by Narendra Modi for this election campaign has become shrill. Pakistan has nearly always been an electoral issue in India. However, this time, it is Indian Muslims who are bearing the brunt of the Indian prime minister’s hate speech. Speaking in Rajasthan last month, he called Muslims “infiltrators” and said they produce too many children. In Gujarat, where, as chief minister, he had overseen the massacre of Muslims in 2002, he accused the Congress of seeking to “loot” India’s wealth and redistribute it among Muslims, and of organising a ‘vote jihad’ against his leadership. Later, he accused the Congress and Muslims of stealing Hindu wealth and property.  Modi’s inflammatory rhetoric was followed by the BJP’s campaign video portraying Muslims as outsiders who plundered India’s wealth. As concerns grew about communal violence, the video was removed. These allegations are a sequel to Modi’s public referencing of earlier conspiracy theories of ‘love jihad’ (Muslims forcibly converting Hindu women and marrying them to increase the Muslim population) or ‘land jihad’ (capturing land to construct religious structures and gaining control of India’s territory). Concerns that his rhetoric might incite further violence against Indian Muslims are increasing. Ordinarily, since Hindus are in a majority in India, it may be difficult to question the rationale of creating a Hindu state. However, two observations are in order. One, the expansionist designs of the cherished Hindu state seek the creation of an Akhand Bharat, a Hindu right fantasy, which would violate the territorial integrity of Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, as per a map displayed in the new parliament building. This is not acceptable to the aforementioned independent states. Two, though the creation of a Hindu state should not translate into discrimination against minorities, regrettably this will be the case. The works of French political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot illustrate how Muslims, 14.5 per cent of India’s population, are grossly underrepresented in bureaucracy, the judiciary, police, and legislative organs. They are second-class citizens.  The Muslim-majority area of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmiri is also being subjected to demographic engineering. The destruction of the centuries-old Babri Masjid by Hindu zealots in 1992 and the construction of a temple in its place has set a precedent that might be followed for other historic mosques. This contrasts sharply with the UAE’s gesture of permitting a Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi. Modi’s anti-Muslim rhetoric is raising concerns of violence. Analysts are also pointing out the fascist tendencies of the BJP regime, a steep decline in democratic values, and a departure from the moorings of pluralism and secularism on which modern India was founded. In her book The Incarcerations, Alpa Shah contends that Modi’s India is using its national security apparatus to incarcerate ordinary citizens for their dissenting views. Commenting on the book, Arundhati Roy stated that this was about criminalisation and incarceration of dissent itself. Strikingly, the Modi regime has also used art and culture to project the Hindutva philosophy. Kunal Purohit’s book H-Pop: The Secretive World of Hindutva Pop Stars shows how Hindutva pop stars and influencers are being used to spread the message of Hindu supremacy and create acceptance of Hindutva’s core beliefs. Apart from this, Modi is playing on his government’s accomplishments: making India the world’s fifth largest economy; the construction of 50,000 kilometres of national highways; boosting India’s mi­­litary spending; bu­­ilding Vikrant, In­­dia’s first domes­ti­­cal­­ly built aircraft carrier; and the Chandrayaan-3 moon landing. His prospects of winning a third term have been bolstered by a weak opposition. Despite the formation of the Congress-led 37-party INDIA coalition, there is no real challenge. What has bolstered his outreach is India’s enhanced global standing. In his book Why Bharat Matters, S. Jaishankar presents India as a leader of the global south and makes a case for the rejuvenation of India as a civilisational state.  There are some lessons that Pakistan could learn from India’s electoral process. One, despite the large scale of India’s elections (969 million registered voters; 1m polling stations) and the use of electronic voting machines, election results are largely accepted without much ado. Two, there is no caretaker government, as the incumbents become ‘caretakers’ in a way, and refrain from announcing major policy decisions or sanctioning expenditure for development schemes. If Modi wins a third term, he is likely to maintain his pro-Hindutva, anti-Muslim, and hegemonic attitude towards regional countries, particularly Pakistan.

FIFA’S FOUL ON PAKISTAN FOOTBALL,"Apathy, manipulation and intrigue seem to define Pakistan football. While players and fans of football continue to rue the state of the sport in the country despite its undoubted popularity, the machinations in its governing body, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF), paint a picture of those at the helm working for their own personal interests rather than for the good of its main stakeholders. But now there seems to be an unholy nexus between such interests and parts of the global football governing body Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) as well. FIFA has suspended the country twice in the last decade alone — including over interference in the PFF elections. Eventually, the world governing body resorted to a stopgap solution of appointing a “Normalisation Committee” (NC) in 2019. It was given the explicit task to hold the PFF elections transparently, while managing football activities, including conducting regular domestic football tournaments, till the appointment of a new governing board.  But even this stopgap solution has now been mired in controversy, with the NC failing woefully short of meeting its mandate and getting multiple extensions to its tenure along the way. One major criticism against this stopgap NC is that the man steering it — Pakistani-Canadian tech entrepreneur Haroon Malik — is trying to set up a franchise league, on similar lines as cricket’s glitzy Pakistan Super League, at the expense of a club-based domestic league necessary for the grassroots development of the sport. This Eos investigation will reveal how Malik is actively trying to engineer a situation that would enable him to continue exerting his influence over the PFF — even after his departure following elections for a new governing body — and how some of the highest-ranking officials in FIFA are part of an elaborate scheme to upend Pakistan football for their own gains. Everyone agrees that Pakistan football needs a regular league system to provide a platform for local footballers and to capitalise on the growing fan interest in the sport. But is a franchise system like cricket’s PSL the best way forward? And why is an interim football administration pushing for it? FAR FROM NORMALISED On a breezy Ramazan night during the second week of March, two football teams took to a ground nestled in the hills to Karachi’s north. There was an extravagant ceremony before the match, with fireworks aplenty.  It was the opening match of the Ramazan Gold Cup. Sights like these have become few and far between in Pakistan football and the PFF had nothing to do with it. This tournament had been organised privately, with domestic football activity having become non-existent in the country. The Pakistan Premier Football League (PPFL), the country’s top-tier competition, hasn’t been held by the PFF since 2018. It’s something that has irked Pakistan’s history-making head coach Stephen Constantine. Constantine — who has been demanding that the league be restarted — wasn’t in attendance at the Naya Nazimabad Football Stadium, however. The 61-year-old Englishman was in Lahore, overseeing the national team’s preparations for its upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan. A day earlier in Lahore, Constantine was visibly irate during an interaction with reporters. Peppered with questions regarding Pakistan’s chances against Jordan — who had recently ended as runners-up in the Asian Cup — the English coach was blunt and unforgiving. Time and again, Constantine has reiterated that it is fundamentally important that Pakistan revives its league structure, which can allow local players to have regular competition. Since taking up the job in October 2023, Constantine has been adamant that a functioning league would allow him to have a greater pool of local players to choose from, instead of working only with those at his disposal at the training camp. He was merely repeating himself six months on. He was also critical of the stopgap NC over the delay in organising the National Challenge Cup, an annual month-long football tournament, which was suspended after the group stages in January last year. For him, the tournament could have been a starting point for the league. “I just heard there were 5,000 clubs in Pakistan,” he said, referring to the results of the recent club scrutiny — disputed at several levels — carried out by the stopgap NC. “You don’t need every district to be part of the league. We had a Challenge Cup with 32 teams. Just take 16 teams from it and start the bloody league.” What Constantine doesn’t know is that the PFF’s internal problems aren’t the only impediment to the revival and resumption of the domestic league. More than a year before his appointment as the chairman of the FIFA appointed ‘Normalisation Committee’ in December 2021, Haroon Malik visited the FIFA headquarters in Zurich for a ‘secret meeting’ that would determine the future trajectory of Pakistan football. GAMING THE SYSTEM To be fair, Pakistan football suffers from a multitude of problems: from a decades-long power struggle over control of the federation, including a hostile takeover of its premises in 2021 — which resulted in a 15-month suspension of Pakistan by FIFA — to the lack of clarity over whether any future domestic league would be a club or departmental event, or if it would take place at all. This is aside from national team players often going unpaid for months, and the country’s and clubs’ abysmal performance in international competitions.  The PFF has also failed on the administrative front, with elections for the new governing body not held in the three years since Malik was appointed to lead the stopgap NC. One of the elections conducted by the stopgap NC, for the referee’s association, remains disputed. In another controversial decision, the PFF allowed newly registered clubs the right to vote — against the PFF Constitution — in the ongoing district elections. These clubs were scrutinised as part of PFF’s extensive programme to register clubs, the long-delayed first step towards holding elections. A novel way of voting has also been introduced for the district elections, with votes to be cast through WhatsApp, which has raised further alarm among the footballing community. There’s a method to the madness, however. Under the PFF constitution, registered clubs vote for district associations, which in turn vote for the provincial associations. Three nominees each from the four provinces and one from Islamabad become part of the PFF Executive Committee (ExCo). The ExCo, comprising a total of 26 members, votes for the president. Other relevant associations and groups, like that of the referees, also have one vote as do the eight departmental teams and the club that wins the women’s national championship. With a simple majority required to win, support from the provinces and Islamabad alone can tip the election in a candidate’s favour. With clubs — that had voting rights previously, when the last PFF election was held in 2015 — set to vote for the stakeholders who have been vying for power for the past several years, detractors have accused the NC of manipulating the still-to-be-held elections by including newly registered clubs. The extent of the control the Haroon Malik-led governing body holds over the election has resulted in concerns over transparency. In the meantime, the government has written to FIFA on multiple occasions, most recently in December, calling for a change in the NC over its failure to hold elections within the prescribed time. Despite the vociferous complaints, FIFA gave Haroon Malik and his team another nine-month extension, in March this year. To understand why Malik continues to enjoy FIFA’s unwavering support and patronage, we have to rewind back to a year before Malik’s appointment as the NC chairman in January 2021. In retrospect, this provided the first glimpse of what was at play and how FIFA was committing the biggest foul on Pakistan football. Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league, only came to light after he was forced out
of the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. Pakistan head coach Stephen Constantine with his players during a training session at the Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium in Islamabad in November 2023: the Englishman has repeatedly expressed his frustration over the lack of regular domestic football in the country | White Star THE MOVERS AND SHAKERS OF PAKISTAN FOOTBALL On a cold December afternoon in 2019, Haroon Malik posed for a picture outside the FIFA headquarters in Zurich. “Discussing Pakistan football! Invigorating meetings, exciting times!” he captioned the picture on X, then known as Twitter. The discussions that took place in the Swiss city on that day would shape the future of Pakistan football. Plans for it had been set in motion months before. In August 2019, a month before FIFA first announced the NC for the PFF, global professional services firm KPMG had begun reaching out to people with knowledge of Pakistan football. During its initial correspondence, the KPMG Football Benchmark department said that it had started “an exciting project on football in Pakistan for a prominent client.” When discussions began, it emerged that it wanted to discuss the holding of a franchise league in Pakistan. Around that same time, a Facebook page was launched by the name of Football Club Pakistan (FCPK). Those working for the page aimed at providing football updates and were employed by media communications company Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan — the Pakistan branch of Starcom, which is headquartered in Chicago and which, in turn, is a subsidiary of global marketing and communication giants Publicis Groupe. FCPK was Malik’s first foray into Pakistan football. Some 15 months after FCPK was launched, the Canadian-Pakistani tech entrepreneur was named the chairman of the PFF Normalisation Committee, following the resignation of his predecessor Humza Khan. But it is what Malik was doing in those intervening months that made his appointment one that raises issues of conflict of interest. A FOOTBALLING CHESSBOARD Back in 2019, leading the discussions on that “exciting project on football in Pakistan” was KPMG’s former sports advisory manager, Yacine Sosse Alaoui. Alaoui has since left KPMG, joining FIFA as its business intelligence manager in September 2020. But a little over six months earlier, in February 2020, Alaoui and Andrea Sartori, the head of KPMG Football Benchmark, had accompanied Malik for a trip to Kuala Lumpur, where they met with officials from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) about what Malik called “discussing opportunities and ideas for Pakistan football.” Malik had not been named as head of the NC at that time. “Haroon Malik came to the AFC in 2020 with people from KPMG,” a source in Asian football’s governing body told Eos. “Discussions with the marketing department centred on a competition.” When the AFC was asked about that visit, a spokesperson of Asia’s football governing body termed it “a courtesy visit.” In fact, it was the December 2019 meeting in Zurich that had reportedly set up discussions with the AFC. The FIFA headquarters is a seven-storey building: two floors above ground and five underground. It was a closed-doors secret meeting on one of those levels that would script the future of Pakistan football. In alleged attendance alongside Sartori, Alaoui and Malik were Mario Gallavotti, the Italian lawyer who heads FIFA’s independent committees; Romy Gai, the chairman of London-based sports industry operators AWE International Group; and Pakistani advertising mogul Raihan Merchant. The proposal was laid out for holding a franchise league in Pakistan with Gallavotti and Gai — who would in 2022 become FIFA’s chief business officer — on board. Their interests remain unknown, but the talk in FIFA at that time was “that something big was going to happen in Pakistan football.” Sartori, Gai and Gallavotti are all Italian. When FIFA was approached for comment in 2022 regarding that meeting, its spokesperson gave a stern reply: “Please be informed that there are no updates regarding the matter you’ve mentioned.” The world football body did not comment on whether Gallavotti and Gai were part of that meeting, although they did not deny it either. Meanwhile Merchant, when contacted by Eos, denied his presence at the meeting. A source close to the discussion, however, says otherwise: “They [Gallavotti and Gai] were really pushing for the league to happen,” the source told Eos. “The purpose of the meeting seemed to push for its endorsement.” It was clear that Malik and his associates didn’t want to come out as rebels. They wanted to hold the league with the PFF’s blessings, as part of the domestic calendar, but also as sole holders of all rights for the event. Football was going to be the third sports discipline Z2C Limited — the holding company for ventures owned by Merchant, which also has Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan, now Brainchild Communications — was going to organise a league for. Malik has been an executive director at Z2C since January 2019 — a position he still holds. Merchant and Malik also are alumni of the same university. Malik’s FCPK would become the ideal social media tool to propagate the league. Meanwhile, Z2C also had BSports — a sports app that combined social and data feeds with a livestream of sports events. It also had digital rights for the Pakistan Super League. The question being raised is whether Malik’s interest is in putting the affairs of the PFF in order as head of the NC or to push forward the franchise league he is invested in. Haroon Malik’s Instagram post showing him at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich on December 5, 2019, more than a year before his appointment by FIFA as the NC chairman | Instagram/roon.toon FIFA’S ROLE While giving another nine-month extension to Haroon Malik and his team till March 2024 — originally the NC had been appointed in September 2019 till June 2020, while Haroon was appointed the NC chairman in January 2021, for a nine-month period — FIFA had warned of possible sanctions being imposed if PFF elections weren’t held by then. But despite little headway being made and multiple deadlines being missed, FIFA has once again extended its mandate till December 2024. “Of course, it’s those links high up in FIFA,” one source close to the matter tells Eos. “With Haroon there, the franchise league plan stays alive.” In the meantime, most former Starcom employees are now working for the PFF, a simple LinkedIn search will show. Hasnain Haider, PFF’s head of digital media, was a project manager at Starcom. PFF’s football performance analyst, Irtaza Hussain, was community manager for FCPK at Starcom. PFF’s current creative manager, Haider Ali, was formerly at Z2C. While the NC has been unable to pay dues to players of the national teams because of an audit objection raised by FIFA, the employees continue to get paid by funds coming in from the global football body. “The PFF is effectively being run by Starcom,” a source in the NC tells Eos. “The groundwork is being laid for the franchise league they want to hold.” Malik, though, hasn’t been the only one looking to organise a football league in Pakistan. UK-based TouchSky Group, Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Peshawar Zalmi owner Javed Afridi and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa football official Shahid Shinwari have all publicly stated their intentions of doing so as well. TouchSky, later rebranded as Global Soccer Ventures and now repackaged as Pakistan Football League, is set to unveil its franchise league next month. It has set a date of November 1 to hold its franchise league which, contrary to the brochures it has been sending out, does not have the endorsement of the English Premier League or its clubs. But with the PFF having the final say over any league, Haroon’s position as the NC chief, which will see him hold elections for a new executive committee of the country’s football governing body, means there is a conflict of interest, even if he says that FIFA doesn’t think there is any. “Anyone associated with football, anywhere in the world, would have some stake in the game,” Haroon told Eos in April 2021. “It is normal, and natural. You cannot have someone who knows nothing about football, nothing about the market that they are operating in, and be responsible for football. Employers determine if conflict of interests are potentially troublesome. FIFA determined that my commercial interests have no conflict with this role [as NC chief]. If FIFA is okay, then that is the final word.” In fact, FIFA did not specifically comment on Haroon’s commercial interests having a conflict with his role, but its spokesperson said that “in line with standard procedures, all members of the Normalisation Committee were subject to stringent eligibility checks.” The spokesperson did not disclose whether FIFA had knowledge of Haroon’s elaborate plans of holding a league, or whether they were investigated during the eligibility checks, but added: “FIFA has no further comment at this stage.”  TAKING INSPIRATION FROM THE PSL In 2015, Z2C helped launch the PSL. Its affiliate, Blitz Advertising, was a broadcasting, live-streaming and a marketing partner for the league. But the partnership fell apart due to a legal dispute in 2020, with the Pakistan Cricket Board claiming victory in its arbitration proceedings against Blitz over rights fee payments related to the PSL two years later. Blitz has long harboured hopes of holding a football league on similar lines. With football being an untapped market in Pakistan, with massive potential returns for the initiators, they aren’t the only ones. For some time, Badar “Bobby” Refaie, the former director marketing of the PCB, seemed to be driving forward Z2C’s football ambitions externally, even though he brushed it off as small talk in a conversation during a PSL match in 2021. “They just can’t get it together,” he said. Badar has been involved in almost every sport — from organising a tour of hockey legends to Pakistan to the National Volleyball Championships.  “Working on new ideas, beside PSL for your Sports projects [sic],” he wrote to Merchant on a Facebook post in March 2019, adding three pictures: a group photo of former hockey stars with the chief of army staff, one of himself alongside squash great Jahangir Khan and another of Spanish football legend Carles Puyol waving to crowds at the National Stadium in Karachi, during the final of the 2019 PSL. Puyol’s visit to Karachi was part of a series of launch events for the World Soccer Stars which, in November 2019, saw him, Brazilian Kaka, Portuguese Luis Figo and Frenchman Nicolas Anelka play two exhibition matches in Pakistan. Ahead of the PSL final in March that year, TouchSky — who were also behind the World Soccer Stars event — had inked a deal with the PFF, which was elected in 2018 following elections conducted on the orders of the Supreme Court and not recognised by FIFA, to organise two leagues: a franchise league and a rebranded version of the Pakistan Premier Football League. The deal, and their plans, came crashing down when FIFA appointed the NC to oversee football affairs in Pakistan. TouchSky tried to do a similar deal with the PFF NC of Haroon’s predecessor Humza Khan, but were rebuffed.  ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES? Haroon Malik’s and Z2C’s plans had already taken off the ground by then. Visits to both AFC and FIFA had been completed. And once Humza Khan resigned, Malik’s path to take up the reins of the NC was cleared — thanks to support from Gallavotti, one of FIFA president Gianni Infantino’s key advisers. But Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league — only came to light after he was forced out of the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, Ashfaq Hussain Shah, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. That forcible takeover of PFF headquarters by Shah eventually saw FIFA ban Pakistan for 15 months. Malik aired his views on franchise leagues after FIFA and UEFA crushed plans for a breakaway European Super League (ESL), which was in many ways akin to the franchise system common in American sports. “Looking at our club structures and history, there are multiple options here,” Malik expressed on X, while delving into a discussion on the collapsed ESL. “A hybrid model transitioning into promotion/relegation makes sense to me. [America’s] Major League Soccer, [Japan’s] J-League is a good conversation starter.” Malik expanded on this: “So many possibilities. Bottom line — either one is good for the players! Get them playing! Enablers: Fandom, Partnerships and Broadcast. Not insurmountable!” When asked why a traditional league model — which would see the country’s football club culture thrive — might not be better than a franchise league model for Pakistan, Haroon replied, “We are a ways away from club licensing, and regulations get stringent everywhere.” However, franchise leagues run for a short period of time, with little time to invest in grassroots football or academies. Club football, on the other hand, runs through the calendar year, giving players the opportunity to get regular competitive football. Moreover, club-based leagues have the system of relegation and promotion, which operate on sporting merit, while franchise leagues are closed competitions. The Major League Soccer (MLS) — a franchise league system — has achieved huge popularity in the United States. The MLS, however, runs like a regular league, filling up a calendar year. In India, the Indian Super League had to eventually be expanded for it to become the country’s national league. Its current season, which began in September, will culminate in May. Another concern is that franchise teams will take up a sizeable chunk of whatever sponsorship is on offer, leaving nothing for the clubs to fund their programmes. This is already a problem for Pakistani club sides. With the PPFL largely made up of departments, and with none of the teams fulfilling AFC’s club licensing regulations, Pakistan has been unable to send a representative to continental competitions. Malik, however, believes that wouldn’t be a concern for potential team owners in the model suggested by him. “Setting up the commercial model is key, adapted to our local market and the sporting culture here,” he said during that exchange. “Once that is done, everything is like Tetris, blocks falling into place.” Malik’s conviction at that point seemingly stemmed from the fact that his plans were already underway, with FCPK set to take care of fandom and Z2C, with its huge portfolio of clients, making sure of partnerships and broadcast. But the FIFA suspension broke that acceleration. When Malik and members of his NC eventually returned after being handed back the PFF premises that had been taken over and the FIFA ban getting lifted in June 2022, they were given a further year to complete the mandate. The NC was then given another extension until March 2024 and now has until December to complete the process. Meanwhile, detractors insist that the extensions are part of a larger plan to consolidate Malik’s control of the election process and the federation. TIME TO TURN A CORNER Such control over the election is key to bringing the league plan of Malik’s Z2C, Gallavotti and Gai to fruition. If a candidate they’re backing comes into power, it would be easier to get the league rubber-stamped. It would also ensure that the new PFF will effectively be run by former employees of Z2C. “Gallavotti and Gai are part of FIFA’s inner circle, closest to Infantino,” one source in the global football body tells Eos. “If they want the league to happen, it will happen sooner or later.” FIFA’s aim of appointing the NC was to have transparent elections of the PFF but that now seems to be turning into, in footballing terms, a red card offence. The global football body can point to the fact that it was during the NC’s tenure that Pakistan got past the first round of World Cup qualifying for the first time in history. But, even if the league eventually begins, the damage caused to the country’s domestic football scene during the last few years is unforgivable. Earlier this year, the NC made a point of degrading three top-tier clubs of the country. When the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) asked for nominees from Pakistan for the inaugural SAFF Club Championship, the NC shortlisted three clubs from Balochistan — Afghan FC, Muslim FC and Baloch FC — for the event. A tournament between the trio was announced to select Pakistan’s representative, but it never took place, as the clubs baulked at the financial guarantees the NC sought from them beforehand. The NC later stated that the clubs weren’t interested in participating at the SAFF event. It goes back to what Malik said in that exchange on X about clubs not coming close to meeting licensing regulations. Constantine, if he stays that long, will in all probability get a league for his players, but it may not be a club-based one. As far as the clubs in the country are concerned, their fate seems to have been sealed by those in FIFA’s inner circle. The writer is Dawn’s Sports Editor.

Who can rock the hybrid boat?,"A NUMBER of developments over the past week suggest that the establishment is keen to enforce/ maintain the status quo and the only impediment in its path may be an assertive superior judiciary that has been increasingly finding its feet in recent weeks. If jailed PTI leader and former prime minister Imran Khan’s article in UK’s conservative right-wing Telegraph newspaper blaming the military leadership directly for all his woes the week before was not hint enough of the state of play, two public statements by the latter clarified issues rather unambiguously. The first came in the DG ISPR’s press briefing, which was ostensibly called to discuss Afghanistan-based terrorist groups’ involvement in attacks on Chinese nationals working on development projects in the country. But in response to a couple of questions about the PTI and Imran Khan related to the events of May 9 last year, the DG ISPR stated unequivocally that the only path to rehabilitation for the political party and its leaders was to ‘seek forgiveness for attacking your own forces’.  Then, perhaps, talks could happen and that too with ‘political parties’ (ie, the government), as the military had ‘nothing to do with politics’. Imran Khan has been consistent in saying he wouldn’t talk to the ‘powerless political parties’ and that a meaningful dialogue is possible only with the military. The DG ISPR also lamented the delay in the prosecution and sentencing of all those responsible for the May mayhem — including the ‘leaders and mastermind’ against whom ‘irrefutable evidence’ has been gathered and submitted — and, in doing so, appeared to hint at the establishment’s frustrations with what it perceives as roadblocks being erected by the judiciary. The content of the live presser evoked an equally adamant response from the PTI, which went on the offensive, reiterating its stance that May 9 was a ‘false flag operation’, accusing the military’s spokesman of being economical with the truth, and saying it would be happy to live with the findings of an impartial judicial commission into the May 9 events and would even apologise if found to be at fault. If the chief was able to weather that storm then, he appears far more secure now. The military spokesman had pre-empted this demand in his briefing earlier by saying if a probe were to happen, as was being demanded, it ought to start with 2014, and not nine years later. The 2014 PTI sit-in in the federal capital was said to have been instigated and backed by the then ISI chief. This was the first indication that the military was prepared to hold its own accountable for past follies, if it paved the way for the trials and sentencing of PTI leaders it says were responsible for the attacks on defence installations in a number of cities in Punjab and KP. While the spokesman left nothing to the imagination, on the first anniversary of May 9, the army chief added his voice to his chief spokesman’s in terms of stressing the need for punishing the perpetrators of the violence a year earlier, also lashing out against what he called ‘digital terrorism’.  This indicates that harsher curbs on social media are planned. So far, the PTI has had overwhelming social media dominance and had been able to keep a step ahead of its adversaries, but we will find out soon whether it has what it takes to bypass software the Chinese have developed over the years (and Pakistan has reportedly acquired) and successfully used to block dissident content. With this ever-widening gulf between the establishment and the party it once saw as a panacea for all that ails Pakistan, the one thing that many felt could force a rethink in the establishment would have been a public manifestation of the immense support enjoyed by the PTI, as evidenced in last February’s elections. Many Pakistan watchers keenly waited all day for multitudes of PTI supporters to spill out onto the roads and streets of major urban conurbations on the party leader’s call to ‘break the shackles’ and protest on May 9. But the brutal crackdown of the past one year seems to have knocked the wind out of the party’s sails and worn down the workers’ will. People may turn out to vote for it in droves, but did not appear prepared to risk life, limb and liberty in coming out for mass protests. Some small localised protests did happen, but had zero impact in the sense of influencing decision-making in the corridors of power. Going forward, a couple of factors will play a role in steering developments. The first and foremost will be the confidence the army chief has in his control over his institution. His predecessor appointed a dozen major generals to three stars in his final six weeks in office and left the incumbent little room in terms of forming his own team. Natural attrition and the more dramatic exit of a couple of three stars on disciplinary grounds recently has, 18 months down the line, given the chief an opportunity to place senior officers of his own choosing in key roles which will give him greater freedom of action both inside and outside the institution. The promotion of three officers this week, including the DG ISPR, to three stars was another step in that direction. The military saw May 9 as a coup against the chief, a failed attempt to dislodge him from office. If the chief was able to weather that storm then, he appears far more secure now. With the PTI protests failing to gather momentum, the only impediment in his path seems to be an increasingly assertive superior judiciary. It can and will, in all likelihood, challenge the establishment’s pre-eminence in decision-making. It isn’t clear how the latter plans to deal with that, especially because it believes that a direly needed economic revival is only possible under the umbrella of a hybrid set-up and in a relatively calm political environment. Only the judiciary can rock its boat now.

Looming pension crisis cries out for corrective measures,"Pension reform is again a hot topic, but this time, bureaucrats will make it appear as if it is intended to benefit top officials. The reforms go beyond just raising the retirement age or taxing pensions. Instead, a series of actions, similar to those that were done in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), should be seriously considered to reduce the cost of pensions to the government exchequer. The national pension cost will reach nearly Rs2 trillion in FY24, and it is predicted to rise to Rs10tr in the next decade if no reforms are implemented. In 2002-03, the pension cost stood at Rs25 billion, but in a span of just 20 years, it skyrocketed to over Rs1.5tr. Pension reforms have previously been tested in KP and generated the expected cost-saving results. It is high time to rationalise the existing pension programme and transition to more modern schemes available in developing and developed countries. Last week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb proposed to raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 years. It has sparked controversy over whether the government intends to benefit only a select few individuals. This decision has both advantages and disadvantages. In KP, the age restriction was raised to 63 years in 2019 with a projected annual savings of Rs20bn. However, the decision was reversed due to strong protest from bureaucrats, and the court also overturned the decision. However, KP’s other pension reforms remained in effect. KP Advisor on Finance Muzzammil Aslam has a different take on raising the age restriction than his predecessor, who implemented a series of reforms. Mr Aslam believes that the lump sum payment of pension payments will be delayed for the next five years, providing some breathing room for the time being. This will allow the government to show a lower budget deficit. The net impact will increase when the five-year allowances are added to the basic salary, which will be used to pay the pension. The age extension will postpone payments, but total payouts to employees will climb over the following five years. While these efforts provide some relief in the short term, crucial steps must be implemented to address the increasing pension liabilities. The government’s liabilities have jumped from Rs25bn in FY03 to Rs2tr in FY24 There is another idea to tax pensions. It may also face political challenges. However, the KP government has imposed a 5pc pension tax on grades 17 and above on their executive allowance. It is estimated that this measure alone will generate Rs150bn in contributions to a pay-as-you-go pension system. This was not an easy decision, but it was made in KP to obtain some contribution from existing employees. The federal government can look into this step in response to opposition to taxing pensions. KP reforms In 2004, based on recommendations from a World Bank project, the India implemented a national pension scheme wherein employee contributions are matched by the government. Pakistan did not choose to adopt it since it was not anticipated that the cost would rise so dramatically over the next 20 years. Taimur Khan Jhagra, former finance minister of KP, took the lead in implementing a series of pension reforms, including the introduction of a contributory pension scheme for new employees beginning July 1, 2022. Few substantial changes were made to the existing pension programme. A well-known 13-tier pension system was in place, covering the pensioner’s widow, children, parents, siblings, sisters, and grandchildren. KP confined it to direct dependents. The federal government did the same last year, but other provinces have not followed suit. The previous PTI government raised KP and Punjab’s minimum retirement age to 55 from 45, reducing KP’s pension bill by Rs20bn alone. KP consolidated various pensions into a single one. Previously, individuals could receive two pensions simultaneously, with an active employee receiving both a salary and a pension. The major reform is the implementation of a contributing pension scheme for new employees. Under this programme, the KP government contributes 12pc and employees contribute 10pc. So far, 40,000 staff have been hired under this system starting July 1, 2022. There are additional critical reforms that the KP and federal governments should implement, such as revisiting the single Universal Pay Scale between Grades 1 and 22. Pay in provinces is decoupled from the Centre and between departments, allowing each department to develop a pay scale appropriate for their budget and the market value of their professions. Pension reforms are greatly needed. The question is whether the state will be able to sustain pension payments for the next 10 to 15 years.

SMOKERS’ CORNER: KHAN AND THE GENERALS,"In May 2023, a recorded phone call — allegedly between the mother-in-law of the former Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Atta Bandial, and the wife of a lawyer-member of Imran Khan’s populist Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) — was ‘leaked’ on social media. In the call, the two ladies can be heard criticising the coalition government made up of the parties that had ousted Khan’s regime in April 2022 through an act of parliament. At one point in the leaked conversation, the mother-in-law laments, “Yeh kambakht martial law bhi tau nahin lagaatay! [These cursed people don’t even impose martial law!]” By ‘kambakht’, she meant the military establishment (ME). The conversation was surreal on many levels. Khan had been the ‘blue-eyed boy’ of the ME, until he had a falling out with his ‘makers’. From 2011 till he was elected as prime minister in 2018, the ME had successfully shaped Khan’s political rise in a highly coordinated manner. His ‘popularity’ was first established within the rank and file of the military. Then, some TV journalists were brought on board, followed by the induction of some vital members of the judiciary.  This troika — the ME, the electronic media and the judiciary — was complimented by the trained social media wing of Khan’s PTI to proliferate narratives pitched against the two older mainstream parties, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The two were deeply demonised as being ‘corrupt’. After his ouster, Imran Khan was convinced that the establishment had ‘betrayed’ him, and the May 9-10 protests last year were an attempt to rally support amongst ‘pro-Khan’ factions in the military. However, any military intervention was drastically overestimated by his supporters A constituency that had initially been built by the former military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf, and which mostly consisted of middle-class and upper-middle-class Pakistanis, was navigated by the ME and the media in such a manner that it eventually fell in Khan’s lap. This became a quadrilateral elite, comprising the ME, the media, the judiciary and the middle classes. After Khan’s ouster in April 2022, he began to publicly lambast the ME, accusing it of ‘betraying’ him. But the truth is, due to the many abject failures of Khan’s government, the ME had begun to gradually distance itself from him months before he was ousted. In February 2022, Bandial became the CJP. He was cut from the same cloth that at least four of his predecessors were. These included Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and, even more so, Justice Saqib Nasir, Justice Asif Khosa and Justice Gulzar Ahmad. Anti-PTI parties often accused them of being overtly pro-Khan. Justice Bandial was accused of having a ‘soft corner’ for Khan. Truth is, Bandial wasn’t very good at hiding this soft corner. Now the question is, during the time of the aforementioned phone call leak, when Khan was holding angry rallies and condemning the ME, why was Bandial’s mother-in-law yearning for a military takeover? Equally surreal was the presence of banners in some pro-Khan rallies with “We Want Martial Law” written on them. Also, why did the PTI — by planning last year’s violent riots on May 9 and 10, in which PTI supporters and members attacked military property — believe that this would cause a split in the armed forces and bring ‘pro-Khan’ generals to power? Many academics who study coups are of the view that, if the conditions allow, street protests can be followed by a coup d’etat. According to the political scientist Scott A Tyson, protests are often a ‘signal’ to the elites to intervene.  The elites in this context are the military and political elites. These may also include the higher judiciary and business elites. A regime facing the protests, too, is made up of political elites. Once the anti-regime elites decide that the protests are clearly signalling for an intervention, this is then communicated to the state elites. The media too plays a role in this. Its reporting of the protests may strengthen the signal and galvanise the military to intervene. The mother-in-law’s ‘kambakht’ lament was expressing a desperate yearning within sections of economic elites for military intervention. This nature of signalling was loud and clear on numerous WhatsApp groups when Khan was holding rallies against his ouster. The signal became even more obvious when the “We Want Martial Law” banners began to appear at the rallies. Some media personnel also started enhancing the signal to the ME. But by late 2022, the ME’s top leadership had changed. A general who had earlier exited the project that was set up to facilitate Khan’s rise became the new army chief. Yet, PTI believed that many remnants of the project were still active within the military. I believe that with the judiciary still in facilitation mode, the notion of causing a split within the military to replace the new military chief with ‘pro-Khan’ generals was the brainwave of some retired military men who were well-versed in the theories of post-protest coups. Once the signal to intervene in Khan’s post-ouster rallies was ignored by the new ME, a violent uprising was conceived that was to target the new ME. The ‘uprising’ was enacted to evoke the ‘concerns’ of the supposed pro-Khan generals. The signal now was: eject the new army chief and intervene (on the side of Khan) to avoid an all-out civil war. This ‘plan’ could not have been formulated without the input of some retired officers. Many of them had been quite vocal in their support for Khan.  The violent May 9 and 10 protests were orchestrated by a political elite (PTI) against another set of elites (the coalition government) to signal the need for an intervention to judicial and military elites. But, according to Tyson, whether or not a coup will succeed is generally not certain to elites. This uncertainty is caused by the uncertainty regarding the actions of other elites. The ‘other elite’, in the context of the May 9 and 10 riots, was the military. An intervention by ‘pro-Khan’ officers was drastically overestimated by the planners and the plan collapsed. The coalition government was able to withstand the assault. The new military chief began to swiftly oust the remaining ‘pro-Khan’ elements from the military — even though those remaining in the judiciary are now trying to avoid suffering a similar fate through a pushback in the name of the ‘independence of the judiciary.’ This, too, is quite surreal.

A turbulent 2023,"PAKISTAN faced a tumultuous year in 2023 marked by severe economic distress and a sharp erosion of civil liberties. As documented in the HRCP’s annual report, the year was nothing short of a human rights crisis on multiple fronts. Economic hardship was pervasive, with back-breaking inflation — nearly 40pc — and low growth hitting the common citizen the hardest. Protests were widespread, ranging from government employees striking against delayed salaries and pension issues to political demonstrations demanding timely elections. The state responded with indifference and sometimes outright violence, underlining its disregard for the people’s constitutional rights. The political arena was no less strained: the year saw unprecedented violence following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan; subsequent PTI-led riots were met with harsh government crackdowns. This included mass arrests and the controversial use of military courts for civilian trials. Political dissent was stifled and freedom of speech curtailed with internet shutdowns and media gags on reporting of certain political leaders. Sadly, the government’s management of the turmoil involved significant overreach, impacting judicial independence and skewing the electoral landscape. The swift passage of laws granting sweeping powers to intelligence agencies and restricting media freedoms points to the government’s alarming propensity to consolidate power at the cost of transparency and accountability.  Human rights violations were not limited to political suppression. The report highlights severe abuses such as enforced disappearances, alleged extrajudicial killings and custodial torture by state agencies. The societal impact of these policies and actions has been devastating. Moreover, marginalised communities, including women, children, religious minorities, and transgender persons, faced increased violence and discrimination. Notable too was the harsh crackdown on peaceful assemblies like the Baloch Yakjehti Council’s protests. On the international front, despite engaging with global human rights mechanisms, Pakistan’s selective adherence to recommendations concerning enforced disappearances and the use of the death penalty reflected a reluctance to fully align with international human rights standards. Rulers would do well to remember that adhering to those standards will help maintain Pakistan’s desperately needed GSP-Plus status and be a more inviting place for foreign investment.  As the year proceeds, it is imperative for the state to reconsider its approach to human rights. The government must ensure the independence of the judiciary, respect for democratic processes, and protection for all citizens against the abuse of power. Laws that infringe on freedom of expression and assembly should be reviewed and reformed. Additionally, there should be a concerted effort to address the economic inequalities that underpin much of the social unrest. For a stable and prosperous Pakistan, human rights must be more than an ideal; they must be an integral part of governance and everyday life.

Love knows no boundaries at Karachi’s Edhi Home nursery for special children,"KARACHI: It’s one day to Mother’s Day and the children’s nursery at the Edhi Home in Mithadar is decorated with balloons and posters along with framed photographs of the late couple Abdul Sattar Edhi and Bilquis Edhi. Children in the classrooms are busy making greeting cards, drawing pictures of themselves and the only woman whom they have come to know as their mother, their Chhoti (younger) Mummy Sabah Faisal Edhi. The duties of the busy mother of so many children, including four of her own, starts from early morning. After tending to her own household duties and sending off her youngest, Moosa Edhi, to school, she is in the nursery at 8am sharp, inquiring from the staff there if everyone had a good sleep, if anyone had any issues during the night. It has become a habit with her to visit the nursery first to inquire about her babies before getting to her other work of calling up the other Edhi Homes and Centres, asking about the other children, their health and school progress, asking about the women in their Homes, tending to the marriage proposals, and adoption procedures and planning outings and picnics for the children. When parents discover their babies are ‘not well’, they quietly leave them in our cot, says Sabah Edhi as country celebrates Mother’s Day today But today, before she can go inside the nursery, she stops in the playroom to admire three-year-old Fatima’s greeting her with a broad smile and a happy dance. Chhoti Mummy hugs the child and gestures to know if she has eaten breakfast. Fatima is deaf and mute. She has only recently been fitted with a cochlear implant, which has enabled her to hear and appreciate music to which she loves to dance. It is quite obvious that Sabah’s favourite in the nursery is five-year-old Moosa, named by Mummy, Bilquis Edhi, herself, after her own youngest grandson, Sabah and Faisal’s youngest son Moosa. But this Moosa, even though he is five, doesn’t look more than a year old. His growth is stunted. Sabah lifts him out of his cot and cuddles him lovingly. The nursery only has special children or children with learning disabilities. Moosa was the last child here named by Bilquis Edhi. The rest have been given names by their Chhoti Mummy. There are two newborn baby girls, Aimen and Noor Fatima, peacefully sleeping in their cradles in the cheerful blue nursery. Both the babies are blind. “The moment some parents discover that all is not well with their babies they quietly leave them in our cot,” says Sabah. “They never return for them,” she sighs. “Parents of very sick children, too, disown them even when they know that their child doesn’t have much time to live. We take them in, find them the best of medical care till the last of their breath,” she adds. “On discovering a child in the cot, we first try to get information about who left him or her there followed by a thorough medical check-up. If they are in need of medical care, we make sure that they receive the best that there is. Just the other day, someone left a little girl suffering from diarrhoea. She had to be hospitalised,” she informs. Just then one little girl, of about four years of age, who also looks like she is considerably attached to her Chhoti Mummy walks in and runs up to her. “She is normal. There is nothing wrong with this one,” Sabah says. “She says her name is Manahil. We found her near Sohrab Goth. Most of the children in our Sohrab Goth Centre are much older so I brought her here with me until we can find her parents,” she informs. “By the grace of God, there is no shortage of space, love and care in this Home built for these children by Edhi Sahab and Mummy,” she says, kissing the child’s head. “All children are a blessing, a priceless gift from God. I wish the parents who discard their children like or neglect them would realise this. I wish such parents could love their special, disabled or sick children like they love their normal children,” she says. “Sometimes, these very children who they love so much because they are normal and healthy grow up to discard their parents when they are old and weak. That’s the story of so many old people in our homes,” she concludes.

Documentary on Dr Aafia Siddiqui launched in Karachi,"KARACHI: Aafia Siddiqui — The True Story, a documentary by Friends of Aafia, was launched here at the Karachi Press Club (KPC) on Saturday. The documentary shed light on various aspects of the life of Dr Aafia from her birth, education, marriage and to her kidnapping in Karachi and confinement in a notorious US prison. View this post on Instagram  Aafia’s sister Dr Fowzia Siddiqui and Muslim Matters’ Editor-in-chief Hena Zuberi and others spoke at the event. Dr Fowzia said that her sister Dr Aafia was a gifted child, a bright scholar and a loving and caring person. She got a PhD degree in neurosciences from Brandies University of the US and it was her dream to revolutionise education system in Pakistan. In the documentary, human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith, who currently represents Dr Aafia, said a vast majority of the American people had no idea who Dr Aafia was and they also did not care.  He said that she has suffered a lot in the US prison and braved all sorts of torture. El-Hajj Mauri Saalakhan, the founding president and director of operations at The Aafia Foundation, told the documentary makers that after 9/11, the US targeted the human rights and liberties of people, especially Muslims. He said Dr Aafia also fell prey to this victimisation and in 2003 she was kidnapped, along with her children, in Karachi and got disappeared on mere suspicion that her husband had bought online night vision goggles. Umme Muhammad, the president of the Musawemem Campaign, said for the last 15 years she had been linked to the case of Dr Aafia but disappointingly nothing more could be achieved.  She said Dr Aafia was targeted only because she was Muslim. Yvonne Ridley was amongst the first investigative journalists who told the world that Dr Aafia was jailed in Afghanistan. Talking about the grey lady prisoner of Bigram jail, she said in those times the US administration would dehumanise the prisoners and the same was done to Dr Aafia. She was wounded by the US soldiers and in injured condition she was brought to the US and tried by a court in a highly biased manner and jailed for long 86 years, which means the rest of her life. Zeina El-Debis, leader of the Friends of Aafia and founder of the Shade of Mercy Foundation, talked about their efforts to get Dr Aafia repatriated on humanitarian grounds. She said the documentary was also a part of such efforts. Published in Dawn, May 12th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832958/documentary-on-dr-aafia-siddiqui-launched-in-karachi
Situationer: Riverine region in the crosshairs of militia violence,"DESPITE a year-long anti-dacoit operation in upper Sindh’s riverine area, the dacoit factor remains an enigma for the provincial police. The situation took a new turn on May 5 when the Bugtis, allegedly backed by the Punjab police and equipped with military-grade weapons, infiltrated the riverine area of Rwanti in Ghotki, which lies on the Sindh-Punjab border, adding a new layer of complexity to the ongoing operation. The recent incident has once again laid bare the seeming helplessness of the Sindh police, sparking outrage among the province’s intelligentsia. The scourge of dacoits has long plagued parts of northern Sindh, with the government’s efforts to eradicate them yielding little success. Despite continued endeavours to tackle the issue, the desired results remain elusive. The Kalpar Bugtis, led by their chief Jalal Kalpar Bugti, claimed to have exacted revenge for the murder of his 30-year-old son, Abdul Rehman Kalpar, by killing two prominent dacoits from the Shar community and injuring half a dozen others. The incident occurred in the Machhko police station area, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Punjab police. The dacoits killed were identified as Alim alias Almo Shar, brother of Sanu Shar, and Hakim alias Haku Shar. Rehman Kalpar was ambushed and killed by dacoits on Feb 13 while he was travelling on the CPEC road in Ghotki district. Jalal Kalpar reached out to the Sindh police, seeking their assistance in avenging his son’s murder, according to a senior police officer familiar with the situation. Dacoit issue remains an enigma for Sindh police Jalal Kalpar is unapologetic and straightforward in justifying his actions. “I repeatedly reached out to the Ghotki police, but they ignored me. I went to perform Umrah, and upon my return, I was approached by the Punjab police to liaise with them and see how things work,” he told Dawn over phone from Sui in Balochistan.  Jalal alleged that Ghotki police SSP Anwar Khetran made excu­ses, claiming that his force was outgunned by the dacoits, as they only had G-3 and Kalashnikov rifles. However, he added, Mr Khetran did acknowledge that geo-fencing evidence had confirmed the involvement of the Shar community in his son’s murder. “Punjab police sought help from me in terms of human resource and police would lead the offensive. My men were there as a cover. Finally, Shars were killed in Machko police limits of Punjab. Sindh police didn’t do anything in this offence,” Jalal alleged. Jalal Kalpar hails from those Bugti families who defied the late Nawab Akbar Bugti and were subsequently displaced from Dera Bugti, settling in Sindh. Following Rehman’s killing, Jalal declared at a jirga in Sui that he would hold accountable those responsible, specifically targeting Shaharyar Shar, the chieftain of the Shar clan and a former PTI leader who later joined PPP. In an attempt to defuse the situation, Shar reached out to Jalal to clarify his position and maintain neutrality. “Jalal conveyed message to Shaharyar that if Abid Hussain Jatoi, Abid Sundrani, or Gul Mohammad Jakhrani stand surety for him, only then will he talk to him. Only Gul Mohammad agreed, and he, along with Shaharyar, met Kalpar at his Sukkur residence, but names of Rahib Khan Shar and Sana Shar emerged as those responsible for Rehman’s murder,” a police officer said. Police post as Bugtis’ base A former SSP of Ghotki said that before the May 5 incident, Bugtis had started arriving in areas along the Sindh-Punjab border. “They [Bugtis] wanted Bhaya-4 police post vacated by Sindh police. This post is manned by Ghotki police, but the area falls in Punjab’s territorial limits. As they wanted to use this post as their operational base, but didn’t find Ghotki police forthcoming in their response, so they turned to Punjab police eventually,” said the officer. According to him, the Punjab police permitted the Bugtis to utilise the Camp-2 location, which was situated approximately 800 metres from Sanu Shar’s hideout. “It’s an ideal location from which they can confront the Shars comfortably,” the officer added. Viral video images revealed that the Bugtis, armed with prohibited and military-grade weapons, disembarked from APCs in the katcha area. The ensuing gun battle, which lasted a couple of days, resulted in the deaths of two Shars and injuries to several others. The Bugtis then departed. According to a former SSP of Shikarpur, the military-grade weapons used were of 82mm dimension, a type commonly seen in Afghanistan. Dangerous precedent Professor Inam Shaikh, an analyst, says, “The incident has set a dangerous precedent.” He urges the Supreme Court to take suo motu notice. “How can state collaborate with private persons? It amounts to creating private militia which otherwise means civil war. Supreme Court must step in to take action against police authorities and criminals for this illegal act,” he insists. Naseer Memon, a writer, has analysed the situation from the perspective of ‘good dacoits, bad dacoits’ and the economy of the katcha area. “The recent episode of allowing one tribe to attack another in the katcha area can snowball this crime into a tribal warfare. This can flare up a bloodbath,” he says. He believes that a multi-stakeholder economy, operating behind the scenes, drives the dacoits, kidnapping, and ransom industry in upper Sindh. A police official reveals that Rahib Shar has been primarily responsible for the kidnapping of people on the CPEC road and other areas. Meanwhile, Sanu Shar has been running a ‘honey trap’ industry in the riverine area. According to another police officer, Rahib Shar is residing in Sindh’s riverine area, while Sanu Shar is based in Punjab’s limits. “Actually, there is a strip of riverine land stretching over around 3-4km that falls in Sindh but administratively looked after by Rahim Yar Khan administration. Since Punjab police don’t pay heed to this area much and Sindh police also remain inactive, it has become a sort of ‘no man’s land’ and a safe haven for outlaws,“ claims an SSP from lower Sindh. “Bugtis aim to target Shars as a community, while the actual culprits, Rahib Shar and Sanu Shar, remain out of their reach.” After the July 28, 2023, killing of notorious dacoits Janu Indher, Soomar Shar, Shahzado Dashti, Nazar Mohammad alias Nazroo alias Kato Shar, and Mubashir alias Mushir Indhar, the Sindh police chief was initially reluctant to take a position. However, the Sindh police later claimed credit for the operation. Meanwhile, the Punjab police also staked their claim. Nevertheless, the Sindh police asserted their right to the head money of Rs8.5 million fixed by the government against Janu, Soomar, and Shahzado. After the Bugti’s onslaught on the Shars, Sanu Shar uploaded a video clarifying that he was not involved in Rehman’s murder. However, this failed to appease Jalal Kalpar, who has temporarily withdrawn from the area but remains resolute in his vow to take on the Shars until Rehman’s murderers are killed. “I have no issues with Sindh or the Sindhi people, nor did I have any enmity with the Shars as a community. It is the Ganderi Shars, specifically Sannu, Moriyo, Jamal, and Rahib, who are responsible for my son’s murder. So, my quest for vengeance is far from over,” he declared. Despite repeated messages and calls, Ghotki SSP Sumair Noor Channa remained unavailable to explain whether criminal cases have been lodged in this regard. Similarly, Rahim Yar Khan SSP Rizwan Gondal did not reply to questions about how Punjab police are backing private militias to take on outlaws. A message was also sent to Sindh IG Ghulam Nabi Memon to get his side of the story, but no contact could be established with him. Published in Dawn, May 12th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832974
To draw or not to draw,"Dazel wasn’t looking forward to school. “That is so unlike you,” remarked Swain. “You love going to school. This is the first Sunday when you’re not looking forward to Monday morning.”  “I don’t like art,” wailed Dazel. “And there’s an art exam tomorrow!” “That’s because you’re not good at art,” quipped Swain. He was amused to see Dazel in this state. The duck was a good student and excelled at everything but she couldn’t draw a straight line as far as art was concerned. “I am going to go to Fruit Park to get some tips from Din Din’s brother, Derek. He is very good at drawing and sketching,” Dazel said bidding Swain farewell. So the entire Sunday was spent getting tips from Derek outside the dinosaur’s cave home in Fruit Park. “Try sketching this tree,” Derek urged Dazel. He tried to help Dazel use charcoal as well as the paint dyes he had. “Try using feathers for strokes; you can also use grass blades.” Dazel tried hard, she really did. But all her attempts were unsatisfactory. When the sun was setting Derek told Dazel kindly, “We should call it a day, Dazel. You look exhausted.” “I don’t understand!” Dazel quacked in exasperation. “I’m following all your instructions but look at how your painting turns out and look at mine!” “It’s okay!” Din Din comforted Dazel. “We can’t be good at everything. I’m not good at studies but I have a green thumb as far as gardening is concerned. Art is just not your cup of tea.” “Yes! I stink at art!” she whined as the two friends trudged to the pond where Dazel lived.
Dazel was drained so she fell asleep at once but as morning approached she woke up with a start, dreading the day before her. “All set for the art exam today?” Swain asked her cheerily. “I guess so,” replied Dazel grumpily. As the two trudged towards the Aviary School for birds Dazel continued to sulk, “The art teacher is weird,” she continued. “If I don’t do well in this exam my grade will drop.” Swain shook his head, “I like Ms. Cardinal. She’s so pretty.” “She’s so stubborn,” said Dazel as they entered school. “She wants everyone to be an artist like her!”
The day passed well but when it was noon and the art teacher came to Dazel’s classroom, Dazel felt miserable. “Today, we are going to paint a scene of nature for the art exam,” said Ms. Cardinal looking bright and alert in her red feathers. “Come my little artists, let’s go to the lakeside and paint the lovely water.” “Nature is the most inspiring thing for an artist,” Ms. Cardinal cooed. “I am handing you this beautiful stone tablet, these some paints and feathers. Paint a scene for me. You can focus on the lake, the trees, the grass or even a flower. Just draw and paint something which inspires you.” Dazel gazed at her blank stone tablet in remorse, “I am going to flunk this exam!” she muttered to herself. Around her she could see the rest of her classmates looking closely at flowers or gazing at the horizon of the lake. Some had already started painting. Candy the canary was busy using a charcoal to outline the beginning of the scenery on her tablet. Even Swain had begun to mix a few colours on his palette. Candy was Dazel’s greatest competitor and the two always competed for first position in the class. “Candy is perfect in everything. I wish I could find out what she’s bad at!” Dazel mumbled to herself. Frustrated Dazel picked up her art supplies and went to a remote part of the lakeside. She heard a splash near her. “Dazel!” Delma the dolphin cried. “Delma! Why aren’t you at the Aquatic School?” Dazel asked forgetting her problems in her delight on seeing her best friend. “I am running an errand for Luke, my Science teacher,” Delma explained. “What are you doing here during school hours?” “I have an art exam and you know how bad I am at drawing and painting!” Dazel said mournfully. Dazel knew Delma was an exceptional artist and had painted several murals on the cove walls of the Aquatic School. “Let me see what you have done till now,” the dolphin offered. She saw the uneven strokes the duck had made. “Give me those blades of grass,” Delma instructed. Within a few minutes  Delma had dabbed the grass stalks in some paint and created a vivid painting of the weeping willow tree growing at the edge of the lake. “Wow!” Dazel breathed in amazement. “I’ve got to go report back to school,” Delma said hastily. “Hope this is good enough for you. I’ll see you this evening at the lakeside.” And with those words and a swish of her large tail, Delma was off. “Oh my! That’s gorgeous,” remarked a voice behind Dazel. The duck whipped around. It was Ms. Cardinal. “Well done, Dazel. Time’s up; it’s time to return to school to submit your tablets.”
Dazel was tongue-tied. As she walked back to school hauling her tablet with her, her heart was filled with guilt. “This is not my work. I can’t submit this,” her conscience urged her to do the right thing. If you don’t submit this you will fail,“ another voice from within nagged her. Dazel felt she would go mad. “You must tell Ms. Cardinal the truth,” her inner voice screamed. “Just shut up and submit the painting and nobody will be the wiser,” remarked the other voice. Just then Dazel saw that they were passing by her pond home. Her mind raced. Suddenly, Dazel tripped and the tablet fell into the pond water with a splash. “Oh dear!” gasped all the birds in her class. “Oh no!” screeched Ms. Cardinal. “Your beautiful painting is lost.” She gazed at the tablet sink to the bottom of the pond. The colours on the tablet were already running in the water. It seemed strange that Dazel did not look flustered as was expected. She just shrugged and followed the group of her classmates to the Aviary School. “I’m sorry for that unfortunate accident,” Ms. Cardinal told Dazel once everyone had submitted their paintings. “I’ll let you give a retest right now. You may paint anything you want from around the school premises.” Dazel agreed and soon submitted the painting of a berry bush growing near the school. “I’m afraid it’s not as good as your painting of the weeping willow but unfortunately I will have to mark you on this,” Ms. Cardinal said shaking her head regretfully. “It’s okay, Ms. Cardinal. I want you to do the right thing,” Dazel replied solemnly.

PAKISTAN’S MOMENT OF YOUTH,"The future of Pakistan — good or bad — will be determined by its young; most especially by those who are between 15 and 29 years of age today. This, of course, is a cliché. But it happens to be a cliché that is quite literally true. Here is why.  Pakistan’s ‘youth bulge’ is palpable. Just over two out of every three Pakistanis today are below the age of 30 and just under one in every three is between 15 and 29 years of age (our definition of youth). What the demographic momentum imbedded in this one statistic implies is that Pakistan is not just a young country, but that it is going to remain young till at least to 2050, possibly longer.  More importantly, my own research suggests that the youth of Pakistan know this and they expect being given the attention and respect this demographic reality demands. Others who have looked at the question have come to similar conclusions. But the fact of the matter is that we do not need statistics to tell us that Pakistan is a young country. You just need to look around you. Any street. Any marketplace. Advertising on your television set. Certainly, on your Twitter feed. Any political jalsa [gathering]. Any office. Even elected officials and unelected political influentials. The generational change is not on its way. It’s here. It’s set. And, most importantly, it’s here to stay. At least for, and probably for more than, the next two decades. With the majority of Pakistan’s population below the age of 30, the young will invariably influence the country’s future trajectory. However, where the youth of today take this country will depend on the choices that today’s policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make. Eos presents an excerpt from an essay by Adil Najam from the book Pakistan: Search for Stability, published by Oxford University Press…  BEING YOUNG IN PAKISTAN In 2017, the Pakistan Human Development Report produced a comprehensive profile of youth in Pakistan, including a wealth of empirical and opinion data on the young, collected from an estimated 130,000 Pakistanis. However, the key question that we, the authors of the report, were most concerned with was “what does it mean to be young in Pakistan?” Not surprisingly, no easy answers were forthcoming. Like so many other places in the world, being young in Pakistan is both exciting and frustrating. The space that the young occupy in Pakistani society is vast and full of possibilities but, in their own words, is often described as crumbling, contested and constrained on the one hand, and uneven, unfair and uncertain on the other. It is a space that is defined by high hopes, but also deep fears. As subsequent research and events have confirmed, to be young in Pakistan is to be highly agitated, and very often angry. Our research does begin pointing out some of the reasons why this is so. For example, if you were to computationally condense the over 60 million young Pakistanis aged between 15 and 29 into a statistically representative one hundred young people, you would find that just 30 of them consider themselves to be functionally literate, 29 would never have gone to school (despite all being 15 or above), only 6 would have 12 or more years of education and just 39 would be employed. More telling, however, are the structural depravations which highlight that the space ‘to be young’ is severely constrained and shrinking. Of the 100, only six would have access to a library, only seven to a sports facility, just 21 to a park. Only three would have ever been to a cinema, only three to a live music performance. Fifty-nine would say that they do not play sports, or only infrequently. One in the 100 would own a car, 12 a motorcycle, 10 a bicycle and 77 would have no means of personal mobility. Each of these depravations becomes even more acute for women, rural youth, and other marginalised groups within the young. And, yet, within this notional 100, we also found a spirit of great national pride, high aspirations, much hope, and tremendous expectations. They were eager to announce, to any who wish to ride the tiger of Pakistan’s youth, to never forget that this is a generation that demands and deserves better. They are politically excited, excitable and astute. While only 24 percent said (in 2016) that they trusted political leaders, 90 percent of young men and 55 percent of young women claimed that they would vote in the next elections. Of every 100, 48 believe that Pakistan’s future will be bright — although 36 fear it will be bleak. Most tellingly, 67 [of the 100] believe that their lives are and should be better than their parents, only 15 expect themselves to be worse-off than their parents; 89 say they feel happy; 70 say they feel safe. All of them demand the space and conditions in which they can achieve their aspirations. In short, the world of young Pakistanis is as diverse, as differentiated, and as divided as the rest of Pakistan. However, they also have greater expectations and aspirations which, if nurtured, could yield high dividends. Much more telling, however, is the palpable impatience and restlessness which, if ignored, could result in disaster. There are three things to keep in mind as we think about youth anywhere in the world, but certainly in the context of Pakistan. First, and most importantly, youth is a defining category. The reason to think of the young as a category is not just because they are so many, but because — even if they were not this many — the 15-29 year age bracket is where ‘citizenship’ matures. Second, youth is fleeting. Analytically, too, youth is a transitory and dynamic category. Because changes happen fast and furious when one is young, the definition of youth identity and what it stands for can change rapidly, even whilst within that category. Those turning 15 or 16 today can find themselves very distant from those turning 28 or 29 and will very likely not easily recognise the passions of those who would be 16 by the time they turn 28. This may well be true for other categories too but is consequential here, because the short window of this category and the rapid changes within it make notions of what “youth believe”,  “youth stand for”,  and “youth want”, or even ideas of the “youth vote”, are much more transitory and contestable than many analysts assume, and do compound the challenges of youth representation. Finally, youth — especially in Pakistan — is an extremely diverse category. At one level, any category of well over 60 million individuals cannot possibly be homogenous and would demand an investigation into its internal contradictions. But, much more than that, each of the major cleavages that exist in Pakistani society are compounded in its young: gender, class, rural-urban, wealth, technology, ethnicities, religiosity and sectarianism, and geography.  PAKISTAN AND ITS YOUNG: THREE PROPOSITIONS Building and extending on the available research, let us review three key propositions — political, societal and developmental — on how the young of Pakistan might influence the future trajectories of the country’s society and politics. These propositions are offered not as predictions or scenarios, but as choice points. Embedded within each proposition are levers of possible change — where the youth of today take this country will very much depend on the choices that policymakers, Pakistani society and the young themselves make on each of these dimensions. Proposition 1: The young of today are defining tomorrow’s politics, but not always in ways we imagine On the face of it, the bold sounds, sights, language, and even substance of Pakistan politics today seems driven by the young. Even where mainstream political parties are still led by septuagenarians, they wrap themselves in the emblems of youth; political rallies of all parties, even religious ones, feel like high-intensity concerts; political communication is not only geared towards the young but most often crafted by them. On the one hand, this is not entirely new, nor surprising. On the other, however, there is something palpably different, as if what would have been ‘regular’ youthfulness is now on steroids. There is significant reason to believe why it is, and will remain, so. At a basic demographic level, all political actors realise how the maths works: the young are the single largest bloc of new and impressionable voters in Pakistan and there is a long-term and steady supply of them. The demography described in the Pakistan National Human Development Report suggests that every election in Pakistan between now and around 2050 will be defined by the youth vote — including, of course, by their choice to vote or not. Notwithstanding the dichotomy of young Pakistanis claiming high intent to vote and a history of not having done so in the past, the number of young entrants into the voting mix means that, mostly within two election cycles, today’s new voter would be about to — or would already have — enter(ed) a burgeoning 30-49 years middle-age category historically the most reliable and loyal voting group in Pakistan. The political logic of investing in the young voter is impeccable. But demography alone does not explain the dominance of the youth voice in Pakistani politics today. Technology seems to have played an even more defining role; a role that is likely to be as enduring. That the rise of ‘new’ (especially social) media would trigger a steep decline of the ‘old’ (particularly print) media was probably inevitable, but the ‘control’ younger political operatives now exert over social media in all political groupings is remarkable and is now driving significant parts of the political narratives in the country. Of course, certain leaders and parties have capitalised more on courting the youth vote than others and have been differently successful in it. This matters, but mostly in ways that it has always mattered. One should not expect permanence in youth loyalties, not least because it remains a dynamic and diverse category.  It remains to be seen if the current and emerging youth bulge will practically change ballot box behaviour, but conditions are certainly ripe to create the possibility. Finally, a very remarkable feature of Pakistan’s emergent political discourse is how explicit mention of youth issues is nearly absent from political narratives. This, despite the feverish pitch of the political discourse, despite the active participation of the young in this discourse, and even despite the role the young are clearly playing in shaping the narratives. A possible explanation for this anomaly could be that politically active youth in Pakistan have convinced themselves that the pathway to material benefits for themselves — particularly, for example, in the area of employment and improved living conditions — lies through the choice of political leadership rather than of policy.  Proposition 2: Give the young the ability to be young or expect a Pakistan tomorrow that is as divided as it is today The idea that we are denying the young in Pakistan the space to be young is a major finding of the Pakistan National Human Development Report. But it is a thought that first hit me like a ton of bricks in December 2014, as I visited the New Muslim College in Charsadda — just days after the horrific terrorist attack at the Army Public School (APS) in Peshawar — to hold a focus group discussion with 15-18-year-olds on what young Pakistanis were thinking. It struck me that the young men with me in the room were not much older than the students who had died at APS just a few days ago, or those who had done the horrific killing. The reality of the APS attack hung heavy in the room and I realised, as did they, that it is the young in Pakistan who have had to do much of the dying in the so-called ‘War on Terror.’ But there was also a palpably steely resolve in the room. Here is what I wrote about that encounter: “Unlike every other APS conversation I had been hearing — on television, on social media, from politicians, in drawing rooms — theirs was devoid of sloganeering. There was no sign of despair. No hollow display of anger or anguish. No camouflaging of fear with bravado. Instead, there was resolve. Very endearing. Very becoming. Very mature. A very matter-of-fact recognition that this was the reality of the Pakistan they had inherited. A reality they now have to live with…” It is then that I fully realised the perils of being young in Pakistan. “Extremists are out to indoctrinate the young. Terrorists are out to kill them. Educational institutions can neither guarantee quality education nor physical security. An emergent politics of anger uses the passions of the young as fuel for petty politicking. The result is that the space for the young to be young has shrunk — is endangered.” My research has convinced me that the best gift that Pakistan can give to its young is to return to them the ability to be young. Indeed, it may be the best gift Pakistan can give itself — a future where this ability continues to be denied cannot be good for any Pakistani. Being young is not just about being carefree, it is also about being able to explore. In the shrinking space to be able to do so, the young in Pakistan have already inherited most of the societal divides that define the country as a whole. That as many young Pakistanis consider being a Pakistani as their primary identity as consider their religion to be their primary identity, is probably reflective of society as a whole. But what was the most disturbing aspect of our research was that more than 40 percent young men and 50 percent young women disapproved of having friendly relations with someone from another religion, or even another sect; nearly three out of every four young Pakistanis (men and women) responded that they would disapprove of someone from a different religion or sect preaching their religion. The distrust that defines Pakistani society as a whole is equally prevalent amongst the young.  Just over 20 percent said they trusted politicians, only around 25 percent trust the police, just 40 percent had trust in the judiciary and less than 50 percent in the media. All of this was in 2016, and there is enough reason to believe that trust amongst the young has only eroded further since then. Such a snapshot should be read not just as what the youth of today think, but what the Pakistan of tomorrow is likely to think. The challenges of social division, societal distrust and mutual intolerance are clearly great, but solutions are available. Silly as it may sound to some, given the enormity of the challenges, the very first — and possibly most meaningful, although not always easy — step should be resolute policy in allowing the young to be young. Sports grounds are not a big investment, but they can be more meaningful than we might think. It is remarkable how parochial we have become, and simple steps to enhance mobility for the young, including the ability for travel exchange within the country to get to meet other Pakistanis who may not look like us but are equally Pakistanis, is another small but possibly impactful investment. Safe and affordable mobility (along with reliable childcare and clean bathrooms) for young women, in fact, emerges as amongst the most effective means of significantly increasing women’s participation in the workforce. Obvious as it should be by now, it is worth noting that, as we think about youth as a category for social analysis, now and into the future, the simple dichotomy of ‘young vs old’ is not only un-useful but can also be dangerous. In society, as in politics, some of the greatest and most alienating divisions that exist in Pakistan exist amongst the young themselves. The policy challenge is to find ways to reduce these divisions now before they sink deep roots and are passed on to the future, and to future generations. The goal is not empty slogans of ‘integration’, but investing in practical means for the young in Pakistan to interact with other young people in Pakistan. Across divisions of gender, class, geography, religion and rural-urban-metropolitan, the bridges that need to be built are not just of concrete but of conversation.  Proposition 3: ‘Boom or bust?’ — it’s a choice We began the 2017 Pakistan National Human Development Report with a story that is not from Pakistan. It remains valid and is worth repeating here: “On December 17, 2010, a 26-year-old fruit and vegetable vendor in a small town in Tunisia set himself on fire, following a confrontation with a municipal official about where his cart was parked. While the specifics of what led to Mohamed Bouazizi’s death are unclear, what is indisputable is his fatal self-immolation catalysed protests that toppled Tunisia’s dictator and led to a string of uprisings in the region that came to be called the Arab Spring. “The aim of mentioning this situation here is not to recount what happened in Tunis that day, or in the other countries of the Arab Spring subsequently. [Our concern is] with Pakistan’s youth. So, fast forward to Pakistan. “Can you imagine a situation, anywhere in Pakistan, where a young person feels so frustrated by unemployment, or so disheartened, un-empowered and marginalised, that he takes a measure as extreme as Bouazizi did in Tunisia? One certainly hopes not. But hope alone is not enough. It is the responsibility of the state as well as society to enable an environment for our youth where such a fate is not even imaginable. Not even in our worst nightmares.” Trying to predict whether Pakistan’s demographic youth momentum will end up being a ‘boom’ or a ‘bust’ is a fool’s errand. That Pakistan today has the largest number of young people it has ever had and that this number is set to grow over the next multiple decades, is a fact. How this fact will play out is not a matter of reading tea leaves, it is a matter of policy choice. There is the inherent potential of a ‘boom’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new young entrants into the economy can become motors of consumption, generators of ideas and innovation and harbingers of new social energy. There is also the equally inherent potential of a ‘bust’ in every youth bulge. A large number of new entrants into the economy need new employment, can feel suffocated by the lack of room to grow, and can burn with anger when existing systems they wish for are not enabled to change. Certainly not as simple as it may sound, but the final path taken does depend on the choices made by policy, by society, and by the young themselves.

Pakistan’s iCube-Qamar beams back first images from moon’s orbit,"Pakis­tan’s inaugural lunar satellite iCube-Qamar on Friday transmitted the first-ever images captured by it from the lunar orbit, the national space agency said. The satellite, part of China’s Chang’e-6 lunar mission, was launched from the Hainan province on May 3 and had successfully entered the moon’s orbit at 1:14pm on May 8. The moon is at an average distance of 384,400km from earth. The lunar module was designed by Islamabad’s Institute of Space Technology (IST) in collaboration with China’s Shanghai University (SJTU) and Pakistan’s national space agency Suparco. The landmark images were unveiled at a ceremony organised at the China National Space Agency (CNSA) to mark the successful mission accomplishment, IST spokesperson and head of Department of Electrical and Computer Science, Dr Khurram Khursheed told Dawn.com. They were officially handed over to Pakistan’s ambassador to Beijing, she added. View this post on Instagram  One of the first-ever images captured by Pakis­tan’s inaugural lunar satellite iCube-Qamar shows the moon and the sun. —  Suparco/CNSA The iCube-Q orbiter carries two optical cameras to image the lunar surface. The module is a cube satellite or cubesat — miniature satellites typically characterised by their small size and standardized cubic design. Due to their compact size and relatively low cost compared to traditional satellites, CubeSats offered opportunities for universities, research institutions and commercial entities to participate in space missions and gather valuable data for scientific advancement and innovation. Operating in extreme temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius, the satellite features a 7-kilogramme one-megapixel camera tailored for missions with power constraints.  Dr Khursheed had said the satellite would play a critical role in deep space missions. “Its surface-level analysis capabilities, transmitting images at a modest 1-kbps, will provide crucial data on crater locations, water, and traces of ice on the moon’s surface,” he had said. As the Chinese lander collects rock and soil samples, iCube-Q will spend three to six months orbiting the moon, capturing and transmitting images of the moon back to Earth. The IST said the opportunity to release the cubesat in lunar orbit from the Chang’e-6 mission was offered by the CNSA through the Asia Pacific Space Cooperation Organisation (Apsco). After a thorough evaluation, Pakistan’s proposal was accepted out of all Apsco member states. One of the first-ever images captured by Pakis­tan’s inaugural lunar satellite iCube-Qamar shows the sun shining brightly. —  Suparco/CNSA The Chang’e-6 mission, which aims to explore the moon’s “dark side”, employs lunar research payloads from multiple countries, including Pakistan’s iCube-Qamar satellite. The mission is named after the mythical Chinese moon goddess. Nasa is banned by US law from any collaboration, direct or indirect, with China. On Chang’e-6, China is carrying payloads from France, Italy, Sweden and Pakistan, while Chang’e-7 will bear payloads from Russia, Switzerland and Thailand when it launches in 2026.  Chang’e-6 aims to collect around 2kg of lunar samples from the far side of the Moon and bring them back to Earth for analysis. Chinese state news agency Xinhua had hailed it as “the first endeavour of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration”. China will send a robotic spacecraft in the coming days on a round trip to the moon’s far side in the first of three technically demanding missions that will pave the way for an inaugural Chinese crewed landing and a base on the lunar south pole. The probe is set to land in the immense South Pole-Aitken Basin, one of the largest known impact craters in the solar system. Once there, it will scoop up lunar soil and rocks, and carry out other experiments in the landing zone. With no direct line of sight with the Earth, Chang’e-6 must rely on a recently deployed relay satellite orbiting the moon during its 53-day mission, including a never-before-attempted ascent from the moon’s “hidden” side on its return journey home.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832658/pakistans-icube-qamar-beams-back-first-images-from-moons-orbit
Ruling coalition loses 27 reserved seats in Punjab,"• Speaker suspends PML-N’s 23, PPP’s two, and one member each of PML-Q, IPP
• Decision announced on point of order raised by PTI-backed SIC leader
• In National Assembly, ruling coalition also likely to lose 23 seats ahead of budget session LAHORE / ISLAMABAD: The ruling coalition in Punjab led by PML-N on Friday lost dozens of reserved seats in the provincial assembly when the speaker suspended 24 women and three minority MPAs elected on reserved seats and barred them from joining the house proceedings. Twenty-three of the suspended MPAs belonged to PML-N, two to PPP and one each to PML-Q and IPP. Speaker Malik Mohammad Ahmed Khan took the decision on a point of order raised a day ago by opposition lawmaker Rana Aftab of PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) during the house proceedings. The opposition member had argued that the Supreme Court had suspended the decision of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of allocating the reserved seats of SIC to other parties on the plea that the SIC had neither contested elections nor had submitted a list of nominees for the seats reserved for women and minorities. But Speaker Khan ruled that he had sought opinions of the advocate general as well as the provincial law department and would take a decision only on receiving their reports. Soon after the beginning of house proceedings on Friday, the speaker read out the Supreme Court order and gave the ruling that Rana Aftab’s point of order was lawful and suspended the 27 members immediately. When Mr Aftab pointed out that the suspended MPAs had unlawfully voted for the resolution condemning May 9 violence, the chair said he should have raised the issue when the resolution had been put to vote a day ago. The women MPAs suspended were Maqsoodan Bibi, Rubina Nazir, Salma Zahid, Kanwal Nauman, Zeba Ghafoor, Saeeda Samreen Taj, Sheharbano, Amna Parveen, Syed Sumera Ahmed, Uzma Butt, Afshan Hussain, Shagufta Faisal, Nasreen Riaz, Sajida Naveed, Farzana Abbas, Mariya Talal, Tasheen Fawad, Abida Bashir, Saeeda Muzaffar, Faiza Monima, Amera Khan, Samiya Ata, Rahat Afza and Rukhsana Shafiq. The minority MPAs were Tariq Masih Gill, Waseem Anjum, and Basroji. National Assembly After the Supreme Court’s decision and the Punjab Assembly speaker’s action, the ruling coalition in the National Assembly is also set to lose nearly two dozen members ahead of the crucial budget session. President Asif Ali Zardari on Friday summoned the National Assembly session on Monday (May 13) and the SIC members are expected to seek a similar ruling from Speaker Ayaz Sadiq. After allocating reserved seats to the parties in the NA in proportion to the general seats won by them in the Feb 8 elections, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had withheld the notifications on 23 reserved seats — 20 for women and three for minorities — due to the dispute on the allocation of the seats after the decision of the PTI-backed independents to join the SIC. Later, the ECP refused to allocate these seats to the SIC and issued notifications distributing these seats to the parties in the ruling coalition headed by the PML-N. The ECP allocated 15 seats reserved for women to the PML-N, four to PPP and one to the JUI-F. It allocated one seat each reserved for the minorities to the PML-N, the PPP and the MQM-P. As a result, PML-N became the largest party in the NA with 123 seats whereas the tallies of PPP and the JUI-F rose to 73 and 11, respectively. The ECP had also issued notifications on the reserved seats for women and minorities in Punjab and the KP assemblies the same day. The PML-N had initially won a total of 75 general seats and was joined by nine independents. With the allocation of 19 reserved seats for women and four reserved seats for minorities, the number reached 107. However, after the March 5 notifications, the PML-N had been allocated 15 out of the remaining 20 reserved seats for women and one out of the three remaining seats reserved for minorities, taking the party’s tally to 123 seats. Likewise, PPP had won 54 general seats and was allocated 12 seats reserved for women and two for minorities. After the allocation of four more seats reserved for women and one for minorities on March 5, the number of the PPP lawmakers is now 73, still fewer than the PTI-backed independents who had joined the SIC hoping to get reserved seats. The MQM-Pakistan has 22 members in the National Assembly, while the number of JUI-F lawmakers had gone up to 11 from seven. The SC decision is expected to have no effect in the composition of the Balochistan Assembly as PTI had not won any seat in the province in the Feb 8 polls. However, in the provincial assembly of Sindh, the two reserved seats for women were given to PPP from the share of the PTI-SIC, which had nine members. KP Assembly The most interesting distribution of reserved seats had been observed in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, where the PTI-backed independents had won 91 seats compared to just 19 seats secured by all other political parties combined. However, the JUI-F, which could get only seven general seats to stay on top among these political parties, was allocated 10 reserved seats for women. Likewise, the PML-N, which won six general seats, was given eight reserved seats. The PPP, which bagged four general seats, was allocated six reserved seats. The ANP and the PTI-P, which clinched one general seat each, also remained lucky to have their numbers double in the provincial assembly. However, these MPAs in KP Assembly have not yet taken oath as the speaker has refused to call the session. Gwadar killings Meanwhile, the Punjab Assembly during its Friday’s sitting adopted a resolution condemning the recent killing of 11 workers belonging to Punjab in Gwadar. The resolution presented by treasury members Amjad Ali Javed demanded the federal government arrest the culprits. It also demanded that the centre announce a compensation package for the heirs of the deceased. South Punjab On a point of order raised by opposition MPA Nadeem Qureshi, Punjab Finance Minister Mujtaba Shuja told the house that the south Punjab secretariat was not being wrapped up; rather the officers who had been promoted were being replaced by new appointments. The minister also rejected the stance that the PML-N was against the development of south Punjab and said that the region had been developed the most when incumbent Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was the chief minister of Punjab.

PIA staff forgets to put boy’s body on plane,"SKARDU: Officials of PIA, the Civil Aviation Authority and police try to placate the protesting father of the deceased.—Photo by the writer GILGIT: In a heart-wrenching incident, a PIA flight from Islamabad to Skardu left behind the body of a six-year-old boy at the capital’s airport on Friday, while his parents continued their journey, unaware of the shocking mistake. The parents of the deceased boy were shocked and fainted at Skardu airport when they came to know that their son’s body had been left behind in Islamabad. Mujtaba, a resident of Katshi village of Kharmang district, was diagnosed with a tumour at a hospital in Skardu and doctors referred him to Rawalpindi for treatment a month ago. His father Muhammad Askari and mother took him to Rawalpindi and he had been under treatment at Benazir Bhutto Hospital for weeks. Mujtaba lost his life in the hospital on Thursday. The parents decided to transport the body of their child to their native village of Katshi for burial, through a PIA flight on Friday, as a 24-hour-long journey from Islamabad to Skardu by road with the body was not possible due to hot weather. Shocked parents, relatives protest against airline management’s negligence at Skardu airport The deceased boy’s parents and another relative confirmed their tickets at flight PK-451 from Islamabad to Skardu on Friday morning. They brought the body to Islamabad airport at 6am and completed cargo procedure for the body after fulfilling SOPs and airline’s rules and made the payment. Ibrahim Asadi, a relative of the deceased boy, told Dawn that the body was scheduled to be transported with the parents to Skardu from Islamabad at 9am. He said the flight was delayed for four hours and left Islamabad at 1pm. Upon arrival at Skardu airport at 2pm, the parents were informed that mistakenly the body was not loaded on the plane and left behind at Islamabad airport. The news sparked grief and outrage as parents were shocked and started crying while the boy’s mother and father fainted at the airport. The relatives of the boy waiting to receive the body also gathered at the airport’s lounge and started protest against the PIA management’s negligence. It continued for three hours. Officials of PIA, Civil Aviation Authority and other departments, who were on duty at Skardu airport, tried to calm down the boy’s parents and relatives and admitted their mistake. They assured the parents of bringing back the body on Saturday (today). The PIA officials said the company, which handles cargos at the airport, is responsible for not loading the body and assured the parents that action would be taken against it for negligence. The boy’s parents and relatives chanted slogans against the PIA administration. They said the poor family had paid higher price to transport the body through the PIA flight, but the airline committed a serious negligence. They appealed to the government to take action against those responsible for the negligence. Yousaf Kamal, another relative of the deceased boy, said the body had deliberately not been loaded on the plane. He said Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engr Amir Muqam was scheduled to fly to Gilgit from Islamabad on Friday, adding that the PIA flight from Islamabad to Gilgit couldn’t operate due to the bad weather condition. He said the federal minister had changed his plan and decided to go to Skardu and kept the passengers waiting. He said the flight was scheduled to depart from Islamabad at 9am, but was delayed till 1pm to accommodate the minister, leaving the body behind at the airport.

Downside risks for Pakistan remain exceptionally high: IMF,"Downside risks for the economy remain exceptionally high, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday in its staff report ahead of the government’s talks with the fund on a longer term progamme. An IMF mission is expected to visit the country this month to discuss a new programme, ahead of the government beginning its annual budget-making process for the next financial year. “Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” said the fund in its staff report following the second and final review under the SBA.  The fund added that political complexities and high cost of living could weigh on policy, adding that policy slippages, together with lower external financing, could undermine the narrow path to debt sustainability and place pressure on the exchange rate. The IMF also said higher commodity prices and disruptions to shipping, or tighter global financial conditions, would also adversely affect external stability for the cash-strapped nation. The fund stressed the need for timely post-programme external financing disbursements.  Last month, the country completed a short-term $3 billion programme, which helped stave off sovereign default, but Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has stressed the need for a fresh, longer term programme. Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer and the economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high 38pc last May. The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around 2pc this year compared to negative growth last year. Pakistan is expected to seek at least $6bn and request additional financing from the Fund under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832699/downside-risks-for-pakistan-remain-exceptionally-high-imf
Pakistan remain unbeaten in Azlan Shah Cup as match with New Zealand ends in tie,"Pakistan on Friday secured a tie in their match against New Zealand in the 30th Azlan Shah Hockey Cup. Pakistan’s fifth match today, which was played in Malaysia’s Ipoh city at 1pm (PKT), saw them remain unbeaten throughout the tournament. The match ended in a draw, with both teams securing one point each, the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) said. View this post on Instagram  Senior player Ammad Shakeel is leading the 18-member squad with Abu Bakr as the vice-captain. Japan lead the points table with 13 points while Pakistan rank second with 11 points. New Zealand hold the third position with seven points while Malaysia follow them with a point less. View this post on Instagram  According to the PHF, both Pakistan and New Zealand had not scored by half-time. New Zealand then succeeded in scoring a field goal in the 35th minute of the game. However, Abu Bakr amassed a goal for Pakistan in the 43rd minute while playing at the penalty corner. Pakistan and Japan had already qualified for the final match, which will take place at 5:30pm (PKT) on Saturday at the Azlan Shah Stadium in Ipoh, after winning their respective matches on Wednesday. Pakistan had defe­ated Canada 5-4 while Japan beat hosts Malaysia 2-1. According to Radio Pakistan, Pakistan have won their three matches against Malaysia, South Korea and Canada while the ones against Japan and New Zealand ended in a draw. Meanwhile, after their 3-1 victory against Canada today, Japan have four wins plus a draw. Earlier this month, head coach Roelant Oltmans had said he expected an improved show by Pakistan in the tournament. Oltmans, 69, has served Pakistan’s senior and junior teams in different roles since 2004 and was involved with the youth side in his most recent stint. Pakistan won the Azlan Shah Cup title thrice — in 1999, 2000 and 2003 — and came third in the last edition which was also held in Ipoh in 2022. Malaysia are the defending champions of this year’s edition. Addressing the squad via video link, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar reiterated the government’s commitment to hockey while also mentioning a campaign across all forms of media to highlight the team’s achievements in the Azlan Shah Cup, according to a report from state-run Radio Pakistan. He added that the prime minister would focus on removing obstacles in the development of hockey in Pakistan. Tara said final would be broadcast nationwide tomorrow on Saturday and wished the team luck. “The entire nation is praying for the victory of Pakistan and is looking forward to welcome a champion team.” Rana Mashood Ahmed, chairman of the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, also congratulated the team for reaching the final after thirteen years. He added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would also host the team on its return and address issues impeding hockey’s development in the country.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832670/pakistan-remain-unbeaten-in-azlan-shah-cup-as-match-with-new-zealand-ends-in-tie
Who can rock the hybrid boat?,"A NUMBER of developments over the past week suggest that the establishment is keen to enforce/ maintain the status quo and the only impediment in its path may be an assertive superior judiciary that has been increasingly finding its feet in recent weeks. If jailed PTI leader and former prime minister Imran Khan’s article in UK’s conservative right-wing Telegraph newspaper blaming the military leadership directly for all his woes the week before was not hint enough of the state of play, two public statements by the latter clarified issues rather unambiguously. The first came in the DG ISPR’s press briefing, which was ostensibly called to discuss Afghanistan-based terrorist groups’ involvement in attacks on Chinese nationals working on development projects in the country. But in response to a couple of questions about the PTI and Imran Khan related to the events of May 9 last year, the DG ISPR stated unequivocally that the only path to rehabilitation for the political party and its leaders was to ‘seek forgiveness for attacking your own forces’.  Then, perhaps, talks could happen and that too with ‘political parties’ (ie, the government), as the military had ‘nothing to do with politics’. Imran Khan has been consistent in saying he wouldn’t talk to the ‘powerless political parties’ and that a meaningful dialogue is possible only with the military. The DG ISPR also lamented the delay in the prosecution and sentencing of all those responsible for the May mayhem — including the ‘leaders and mastermind’ against whom ‘irrefutable evidence’ has been gathered and submitted — and, in doing so, appeared to hint at the establishment’s frustrations with what it perceives as roadblocks being erected by the judiciary. The content of the live presser evoked an equally adamant response from the PTI, which went on the offensive, reiterating its stance that May 9 was a ‘false flag operation’, accusing the military’s spokesman of being economical with the truth, and saying it would be happy to live with the findings of an impartial judicial commission into the May 9 events and would even apologise if found to be at fault. If the chief was able to weather that storm then, he appears far more secure now. The military spokesman had pre-empted this demand in his briefing earlier by saying if a probe were to happen, as was being demanded, it ought to start with 2014, and not nine years later. The 2014 PTI sit-in in the federal capital was said to have been instigated and backed by the then ISI chief. This was the first indication that the military was prepared to hold its own accountable for past follies, if it paved the way for the trials and sentencing of PTI leaders it says were responsible for the attacks on defence installations in a number of cities in Punjab and KP. While the spokesman left nothing to the imagination, on the first anniversary of May 9, the army chief added his voice to his chief spokesman’s in terms of stressing the need for punishing the perpetrators of the violence a year earlier, also lashing out against what he called ‘digital terrorism’.  This indicates that harsher curbs on social media are planned. So far, the PTI has had overwhelming social media dominance and had been able to keep a step ahead of its adversaries, but we will find out soon whether it has what it takes to bypass software the Chinese have developed over the years (and Pakistan has reportedly acquired) and successfully used to block dissident content. With this ever-widening gulf between the establishment and the party it once saw as a panacea for all that ails Pakistan, the one thing that many felt could force a rethink in the establishment would have been a public manifestation of the immense support enjoyed by the PTI, as evidenced in last February’s elections. Many Pakistan watchers keenly waited all day for multitudes of PTI supporters to spill out onto the roads and streets of major urban conurbations on the party leader’s call to ‘break the shackles’ and protest on May 9. But the brutal crackdown of the past one year seems to have knocked the wind out of the party’s sails and worn down the workers’ will. People may turn out to vote for it in droves, but did not appear prepared to risk life, limb and liberty in coming out for mass protests. Some small localised protests did happen, but had zero impact in the sense of influencing decision-making in the corridors of power. Going forward, a couple of factors will play a role in steering developments. The first and foremost will be the confidence the army chief has in his control over his institution. His predecessor appointed a dozen major generals to three stars in his final six weeks in office and left the incumbent little room in terms of forming his own team. Natural attrition and the more dramatic exit of a couple of three stars on disciplinary grounds recently has, 18 months down the line, given the chief an opportunity to place senior officers of his own choosing in key roles which will give him greater freedom of action both inside and outside the institution. The promotion of three officers this week, including the DG ISPR, to three stars was another step in that direction. The military saw May 9 as a coup against the chief, a failed attempt to dislodge him from office. If the chief was able to weather that storm then, he appears far more secure now. With the PTI protests failing to gather momentum, the only impediment in his path seems to be an increasingly assertive superior judiciary. It can and will, in all likelihood, challenge the establishment’s pre-eminence in decision-making. It isn’t clear how the latter plans to deal with that, especially because it believes that a direly needed economic revival is only possible under the umbrella of a hybrid set-up and in a relatively calm political environment. Only the judiciary can rock its boat now.

Insurgency and social change,"THE recent killing of seven barbershop workers from Punjab in Gwadar is another indicator that the insurgency in Balochistan is evolving and intensifying demographic changes, which will impact the sociopolitical landscape of the province. Although targeted killings of settlers in Balochistan are not a new trend, the emergence of the Balochistan Liberation Army as the primary insurgent group has significantly increased operational capacities and diversified targets.  While the BLA has not officially claimed responsibility for the Gwadar attack, it is likely the act of one of its wings or affiliate groups. Last month, the group carried out a significant attack, killing nine people from central Punjab who were planning on reaching Europe through Iran. Based on their ethnicity, BLA gunmen abducted them from a bus bound for Taftan and later dumped their bodies under a bridge in a hilly area of Noshki. In a similar attack, possibly by the same gunmen, two people were killed when they tried to escape the assailants’ cordon on N-40, the Quetta-Noshki highway. Following the Noshki attack, the BLA issued a statement claiming that its special squad had killed ‘agents’ of Pakistan’s intelligence agencies who, they claimed, were travelling in plain clothes on the bus. However, media reports and investigations later revealed that the victims were using the Balochistan route to travel to Iran and onward to Europe. Baloch militants view workers and travellers from Punjab as collaborators or agents of security forces or the federal government. Attacks targeting Punjabi workers and settlers have occurred in various parts of the province in the past. It appears that the insurgents kill settlers because they are non-combatants and, as such, easy targets. Militant groups assign such tasks to their new recruits to test their conviction and draw them into the cycle of violence. While one can comprehend Baloch grievances against the state institutions and Punjab, it is also crucial to understand why they target non-combatants who have been serving them for years. Whenever anger flares against the state’s flawed policies, settlers become the targets. Traditionally, Baloch society has a few key professions. Hairdressing is one of the major ones they miss. Teaching comes next, with teachers from Punjab and the Urdu-speaking community making significant contributions to the education sector in the province. Like tribal codes in other parts of the country, the Baloch follow the tradition of hosting members of different ethnicities without integrating them into their tribal ethics. This is a common practice, as assimilation is a long process. The same applies to settlers from Punjab and urban Sindh, who have embraced the norms of Baloch society, while maintaining ties with their native towns and communities.  However, Punjabis constitute the largest ethnic group in the country and wield significant power and resources, leading to resentment not only among the Baloch, but also Pakhtuns and Sindhis. Whenever anger flares against the establishment and the state’s flawed policies, settlers become the targets of this animosity. Historically, barbers have been the first victims when such hatred triggers violence. It is worth noting that many of these barbers hail from southern Punjab, much of which identifies itself as Baloch, but their official domicile determines their identity and ethnicity. Over the last two decades, Pakhtuns have captured market businesses in urban Balochistan, while Sindhis have gradually become prominent in the labour market. Despite issues of ethnic and tribal pride and sociocultural differences, there has been no hostility towards these communities. This is because both ethnicities are part of Balochistan and share some cultural commonalities. Moreover, both communities have faced major hostility, apart from minor issues related to ethnic and tribal pride and sociocultural differences. The reasons are that both ethnicities are part of Balochistan and share few other cultural commonalities, but both are also seen as deprived communities and, in the past, have remained part of the political struggle for rights. Insurgencies have no room for neutrality or ambiguity, as insurgents seek clear distinctions between friends and foes. In places like Myanmar and India, ethnic insurgents target civilians from minority ethnic groups, as well as engage in property destruction and other abuses. While small ethnic groups may strive to maintain a neutral stance, they often find themselves between insurgents and counterinsurgents in grey areas. This dynamic is evident among Pakhtuns and Sindhis, who have been targeted by insurgents while working on government projects. The contractors had hired them as an alternative to Punjabi labour, but they were not spared despite a sense of affinity with them.  Sociopolitical transformation is a complex phenomenon, which is influenced not only by insurgents but also by internal societal changes. Baloch society is transforming due to rural-to-urban migration, increasing literacy rates, and improved connectivity. Similar to Karachi’s experience, urbanisation in Quetta is making other major urban centres multi-ethnic too. Despite ethnic bonds with Sindhis, coexistence with Pakhtuns and Sindhis may face occasional challenges. Additionally, religion presents a growing challenge, as religious fervour increases alongside literacy rates among the Baloch. While this may appear advantageous for state institutions seeking cohesion through religion, religiosity has not weakened Balochistan’s nationalistic sentiments. The promotion of religious organisations and madressahs by state institutions has failed to make a significant impact, mainly due to the vast disparities within Baloch society’s tribal, rural, and urban composition, which foster diverse political interests. The very forces undermining peace are now major power players. At the national level, the province’s poor human development and governance indicators leave ample space for resistance politics. Sociopolitical changes often trigger paradoxical sentiments, with simultaneous pro-development and anti-development attitudes emerging. When the sense of deprivation intensifies, and resource distribution becomes contentious, it creates a conducive environment for militants to recruit, expand, and diversify their targets and tactics. Targeting non-combatants of the majority group reflects a deepening societal anger at this level. This is the most crucial level, as the state has to rethink and correct its approach towards Balochistan. The writer is a security analyst.

Indian elections,"THE Islamophobic rhetoric being employed by Narendra Modi for this election campaign has become shrill. Pakistan has nearly always been an electoral issue in India. However, this time, it is Indian Muslims who are bearing the brunt of the Indian prime minister’s hate speech. Speaking in Rajasthan last month, he called Muslims “infiltrators” and said they produce too many children. In Gujarat, where, as chief minister, he had overseen the massacre of Muslims in 2002, he accused the Congress of seeking to “loot” India’s wealth and redistribute it among Muslims, and of organising a ‘vote jihad’ against his leadership. Later, he accused the Congress and Muslims of stealing Hindu wealth and property.  Modi’s inflammatory rhetoric was followed by the BJP’s campaign video portraying Muslims as outsiders who plundered India’s wealth. As concerns grew about communal violence, the video was removed. These allegations are a sequel to Modi’s public referencing of earlier conspiracy theories of ‘love jihad’ (Muslims forcibly converting Hindu women and marrying them to increase the Muslim population) or ‘land jihad’ (capturing land to construct religious structures and gaining control of India’s territory). Concerns that his rhetoric might incite further violence against Indian Muslims are increasing. Ordinarily, since Hindus are in a majority in India, it may be difficult to question the rationale of creating a Hindu state. However, two observations are in order. One, the expansionist designs of the cherished Hindu state seek the creation of an Akhand Bharat, a Hindu right fantasy, which would violate the territorial integrity of Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, as per a map displayed in the new parliament building. This is not acceptable to the aforementioned independent states. Two, though the creation of a Hindu state should not translate into discrimination against minorities, regrettably this will be the case. The works of French political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot illustrate how Muslims, 14.5 per cent of India’s population, are grossly underrepresented in bureaucracy, the judiciary, police, and legislative organs. They are second-class citizens.  The Muslim-majority area of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmiri is also being subjected to demographic engineering. The destruction of the centuries-old Babri Masjid by Hindu zealots in 1992 and the construction of a temple in its place has set a precedent that might be followed for other historic mosques. This contrasts sharply with the UAE’s gesture of permitting a Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi. Modi’s anti-Muslim rhetoric is raising concerns of violence. Analysts are also pointing out the fascist tendencies of the BJP regime, a steep decline in democratic values, and a departure from the moorings of pluralism and secularism on which modern India was founded. In her book The Incarcerations, Alpa Shah contends that Modi’s India is using its national security apparatus to incarcerate ordinary citizens for their dissenting views. Commenting on the book, Arundhati Roy stated that this was about criminalisation and incarceration of dissent itself. Strikingly, the Modi regime has also used art and culture to project the Hindutva philosophy. Kunal Purohit’s book H-Pop: The Secretive World of Hindutva Pop Stars shows how Hindutva pop stars and influencers are being used to spread the message of Hindu supremacy and create acceptance of Hindutva’s core beliefs. Apart from this, Modi is playing on his government’s accomplishments: making India the world’s fifth largest economy; the construction of 50,000 kilometres of national highways; boosting India’s mi­­litary spending; bu­­ilding Vikrant, In­­dia’s first domes­ti­­cal­­ly built aircraft carrier; and the Chandrayaan-3 moon landing. His prospects of winning a third term have been bolstered by a weak opposition. Despite the formation of the Congress-led 37-party INDIA coalition, there is no real challenge. What has bolstered his outreach is India’s enhanced global standing. In his book Why Bharat Matters, S. Jaishankar presents India as a leader of the global south and makes a case for the rejuvenation of India as a civilisational state.  There are some lessons that Pakistan could learn from India’s electoral process. One, despite the large scale of India’s elections (969 million registered voters; 1m polling stations) and the use of electronic voting machines, election results are largely accepted without much ado. Two, there is no caretaker government, as the incumbents become ‘caretakers’ in a way, and refrain from announcing major policy decisions or sanctioning expenditure for development schemes. If Modi wins a third term, he is likely to maintain his pro-Hindutva, anti-Muslim, and hegemonic attitude towards regional countries, particularly Pakistan.

The lethal troika,"MANY factors were responsible for the defeat of the erstwhile Soviet Union and then the US in Afghanistan. A common factor was the existence of a combination of extremely resilient militant groups resisting both superpowers. This combination consisted of three categories of militants: local Afghan militants resisting foreign invaders; Pakistani militants crossing over to help their Afghan brethren; and thousands of mujahideen from various countries, particularly in the Middle East, participating in the Afghan jihad. With some variations in their composition, role and external supporters, they fought together against the US and USSR for 30 years, forcing them to withdraw. Alarmingly, after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, this Afghanistan-based lethal troika now targets Pakistan. The situation necessitates a fundamental shift in the terrorist threat assessment in Pakistan — from focusing exclusively on the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan to broadening the threat calculus to the troika of the TTP, Afghan Taliban, and Al Qaeda. Concerning the nexus between the Taliban and TTP, the latest UN report on Afghanistan states that the Afghan government was supplying weapons, training facilities and regular financial packages to the TTP. Al Qaeda’s primary goal, after lying low in the region for many years, is to revive itself without annoying its Afghan hosts or attracting the West’s adverse attention. In view of this, it seems to have opted to carry out its activities in Pakistan through the TTP, while staying below the international radar. The importance Al Qaeda gives to the TTP is evident in that it selected 15 of its commanders to assist the group conduct terrorist attacks in Pakistan. It also supplied armed fighters to the TTP in its attack in Chitral in September 2023, which killed four security officials. Al Qaeda’s camp in Kunar, headed by Hakim ul Masri, is responsible for training suicide bombers for the TTP. The TTP, which has been the most lethal terrorist group in Pakistan over the last three years, is on the same page with the Taliban and Al Qaeda not only because of an ideological affinity and a shared history of fighting foreign invaders in Afghanistan, but also due to similar goals of Sharia enforcement in Pakistan. The TTP intends to replicate in Pakistan what the Taliban did in Afghanistan. There were reports of the TTP helping the other two members of the troika by killing Taliban members defecting to the rival Islamic State-Khorasan Province in Afghanistan. The basic point is that while the troika is united on targeting Pakistan, the members play different roles. The Taliban are likely to help TTP discreetly in Afghanistan by providing sanctuary, with Al Qaeda supporting both openly in Afghanistan through mentoring and in Pakistan through its sympathisers. With its edge, the TTP is likely to carry out ground attacks in Pakistan and lead a campaign to build up its narrative of violent extremism. As far as the strategy and tactics to be adopted by the troika go, the TTP intends to replicate in Pakistan what the Taliban did in Afghanistan. In a recent interview to Khorasan Diary, TTP ameer Noor Wali Mehsud stated, “our jihad in Pakistan … has entered a decisive phase”. He went on to say ominously: “Pakistani security agencies have unjustly occupied our homeland” and “our goal is to liberate our homeland and implement the divine law”. In a nutshell, the TTP seems to be falling back on the two-point narrative of resistance in Afghanistan, ie, ‘liberation of homeland’ and ‘enforcement of divine laws’. This brings us to the likely impact of the troika on the terrorist threat landscape in Pakistan. Since 2021, the number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan has been consistently increasing every year. This is likely to continue in 2024, with three possible changes. One, the number of Afghan nationals taking part in terrorist attacks in Pakistan may increase — we recall here the suicide bombing against military personnel in 2023 in Bannu by Afghans. Two, given its penchant for high-profile attacks, Al Qaeda may train the TTP to carry out such attacks. Three, given that the top Al Qaeda and Taliban instructors will train TTP members, the quality and sophistication of the attacks in 2024 are likely to be enhanced. Another area likely to be impacted by the troika is infiltration. Earlier, in the 1990s, Al Qaeda infiltrated educational institutions such as Karachi and Punjab universities to recruit educated youth. These recruitment cells in universities may be reactivated. Also, to stay abreast of latest government planning in counterterrorism, the TTP, like the Taliban did in Afghanistan, may attempt to infiltrate government departments, including intel agencies. The third and most important dimension of infiltration is that of the military, which was carried out by Al Qaeda in Pakistan in the late 1990s. It may be pertinent to mention that the last attempted terrorist attack by Al Qaeda was in 2014 in Karachi, when a group of naval officers tried to hijack a navy frigate and crash into a US ship in the open seas. Al Qaeda worked somewhat openly in Pakistan from the 1980s to 2001, and built up an elaborate network of civilian volunteers in many cities of Pakistan, who assisted in collecting funds, recruiting volunteers, and providing hideouts for the group. These sleeper cells might again be contacted by it and reactivated. Similarly, there were some Pakistani militant organisations of the 1980s, like the Harkatul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Taiba, etc, sympathetic to Al Qaeda and lying low these days. Al Qaeda may re-establish contact with them and get their support for the TTP. Finally, both the Taliban and Al Qaeda are known for their high-quality propaganda campaign. The TTP media wing lacks that finesse. In the light of guidance from the Taliban and Al Qaeda, we are likely to witness a significant improvement in the quality of propaganda. As Sun Tsu stated, “if you know your enemy and you know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles”. Sadly, it seems that Pakistan is erring in assessing the collective capabilities of the TTP, supported by the Taliban and Al Qaeda.

A turbulent 2023,"PAKISTAN faced a tumultuous year in 2023 marked by severe economic distress and a sharp erosion of civil liberties. As documented in the HRCP’s annual report, the year was nothing short of a human rights crisis on multiple fronts. Economic hardship was pervasive, with back-breaking inflation — nearly 40pc — and low growth hitting the common citizen the hardest. Protests were widespread, ranging from government employees striking against delayed salaries and pension issues to political demonstrations demanding timely elections. The state responded with indifference and sometimes outright violence, underlining its disregard for the people’s constitutional rights. The political arena was no less strained: the year saw unprecedented violence following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan; subsequent PTI-led riots were met with harsh government crackdowns. This included mass arrests and the controversial use of military courts for civilian trials. Political dissent was stifled and freedom of speech curtailed with internet shutdowns and media gags on reporting of certain political leaders. Sadly, the government’s management of the turmoil involved significant overreach, impacting judicial independence and skewing the electoral landscape. The swift passage of laws granting sweeping powers to intelligence agencies and restricting media freedoms points to the government’s alarming propensity to consolidate power at the cost of transparency and accountability.  Human rights violations were not limited to political suppression. The report highlights severe abuses such as enforced disappearances, alleged extrajudicial killings and custodial torture by state agencies. The societal impact of these policies and actions has been devastating. Moreover, marginalised communities, including women, children, religious minorities, and transgender persons, faced increased violence and discrimination. Notable too was the harsh crackdown on peaceful assemblies like the Baloch Yakjehti Council’s protests. On the international front, despite engaging with global human rights mechanisms, Pakistan’s selective adherence to recommendations concerning enforced disappearances and the use of the death penalty reflected a reluctance to fully align with international human rights standards. Rulers would do well to remember that adhering to those standards will help maintain Pakistan’s desperately needed GSP-Plus status and be a more inviting place for foreign investment.  As the year proceeds, it is imperative for the state to reconsider its approach to human rights. The government must ensure the independence of the judiciary, respect for democratic processes, and protection for all citizens against the abuse of power. Laws that infringe on freedom of expression and assembly should be reviewed and reformed. Additionally, there should be a concerted effort to address the economic inequalities that underpin much of the social unrest. For a stable and prosperous Pakistan, human rights must be more than an ideal; they must be an integral part of governance and everyday life.

A moral victory,"AS the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly voted on Friday in favour of granting Palestine greater rights at the multilateral body, and eventually paving the way for Palestine’s admission to the UN, thousands of miles away, in the killing fields of Gaza, the people of Palestine continued to face the brutality of the Israeli war machine. Only nine states voted against granting Palestine greater rights, amongst them the US. America’s ambassador to the UN said the vote against the resolution should “not reflect its opposition to Palestinian statehood”. This is doublespeak at its finest. Israel’s other staunch Western allies Germany and the UK abstained, while France voted in favour of the resolution along with 142 other members of the UN. The message from the global majority is clear: Palestine must join the comity of nations and take its rightful place at the UN. However, the Security Council’s recommendation is essential for full UN membership. Here, the US can be expected to torpedo the move, as it has in the past. However, while Palestine may have scored a moral victory in the hallowed halls of the UN, in the hellscape that Gaza has been turned into, its people have no protection from Israel’s campaign of genocidal violence. Despite global calls for Tel Aviv to refrain from attacking Rafah, Israel has refused to listen, and hostilities continue in Gaza’s southernmost area. Even a feeble warning from the US to cut off weapons bound for Tel Aviv has failed to dampen Israel’s lust for Palestinian blood. Despatches from those in Gaza are heart-breaking. A Unicef official reports witnessing a mass exodus, with “people … exhausted, terrified”. He particularly points to the challenges faced by pregnant women and children, many of whom have lost limbs and suffered “horrific burns”. Moreover, famine has spread in Gaza, while Israel has blocked all aid for the last few days. In fact, along with Tel Aviv’s military machine, many civilians in the Zionist state have displayed blood-curdling cruelty towards the Palestinians, with protesters blocking aid shipments to Gaza. Many Israelis, as a society, want to treat Palestinians as untermensch, not worthy of human dignity, just as their forefathers were treated by Nazi Germany. And thanks to Israel’s powerful foreign patrons, they are succeeding, as Gaza’s hungry, bloodied and terrorised people cry out for an end to the nightmare.

The lethal troika,"MANY factors were responsible for the defeat of the erstwhile Soviet Union and then the US in Afghanistan. A common factor was the existence of a combination of extremely resilient militant groups resisting both superpowers. This combination consisted of three categories of militants: local Afghan militants resisting foreign invaders; Pakistani militants crossing over to help their Afghan brethren; and thousands of mujahideen from various countries, particularly in the Middle East, participating in the Afghan jihad. With some variations in their composition, role and external supporters, they fought together against the US and USSR for 30 years, forcing them to withdraw. Alarmingly, after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, this Afghanistan-based lethal troika now targets Pakistan. The situation necessitates a fundamental shift in the terrorist threat assessment in Pakistan — from focusing exclusively on the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan to broadening the threat calculus to the troika of the TTP, Afghan Taliban, and Al Qaeda. Concerning the nexus between the Taliban and TTP, the latest UN report on Afghanistan states that the Afghan government was supplying weapons, training facilities and regular financial packages to the TTP. Al Qaeda’s primary goal, after lying low in the region for many years, is to revive itself without annoying its Afghan hosts or attracting the West’s adverse attention. In view of this, it seems to have opted to carry out its activities in Pakistan through the TTP, while staying below the international radar. The importance Al Qaeda gives to the TTP is evident in that it selected 15 of its commanders to assist the group conduct terrorist attacks in Pakistan. It also supplied armed fighters to the TTP in its attack in Chitral in September 2023, which killed four security officials. Al Qaeda’s camp in Kunar, headed by Hakim ul Masri, is responsible for training suicide bombers for the TTP. The TTP, which has been the most lethal terrorist group in Pakistan over the last three years, is on the same page with the Taliban and Al Qaeda not only because of an ideological affinity and a shared history of fighting foreign invaders in Afghanistan, but also due to similar goals of Sharia enforcement in Pakistan. The TTP intends to replicate in Pakistan what the Taliban did in Afghanistan. There were reports of the TTP helping the other two members of the troika by killing Taliban members defecting to the rival Islamic State-Khorasan Province in Afghanistan. The basic point is that while the troika is united on targeting Pakistan, the members play different roles. The Taliban are likely to help TTP discreetly in Afghanistan by providing sanctuary, with Al Qaeda supporting both openly in Afghanistan through mentoring and in Pakistan through its sympathisers. With its edge, the TTP is likely to carry out ground attacks in Pakistan and lead a campaign to build up its narrative of violent extremism. As far as the strategy and tactics to be adopted by the troika go, the TTP intends to replicate in Pakistan what the Taliban did in Afghanistan. In a recent interview to Khorasan Diary, TTP ameer Noor Wali Mehsud stated, “our jihad in Pakistan … has entered a decisive phase”. He went on to say ominously: “Pakistani security agencies have unjustly occupied our homeland” and “our goal is to liberate our homeland and implement the divine law”. In a nutshell, the TTP seems to be falling back on the two-point narrative of resistance in Afghanistan, ie, ‘liberation of homeland’ and ‘enforcement of divine laws’. This brings us to the likely impact of the troika on the terrorist threat landscape in Pakistan. Since 2021, the number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan has been consistently increasing every year. This is likely to continue in 2024, with three possible changes. One, the number of Afghan nationals taking part in terrorist attacks in Pakistan may increase — we recall here the suicide bombing against military personnel in 2023 in Bannu by Afghans. Two, given its penchant for high-profile attacks, Al Qaeda may train the TTP to carry out such attacks. Three, given that the top Al Qaeda and Taliban instructors will train TTP members, the quality and sophistication of the attacks in 2024 are likely to be enhanced. Another area likely to be impacted by the troika is infiltration. Earlier, in the 1990s, Al Qaeda infiltrated educational institutions such as Karachi and Punjab universities to recruit educated youth. These recruitment cells in universities may be reactivated. Also, to stay abreast of latest government planning in counterterrorism, the TTP, like the Taliban did in Afghanistan, may attempt to infiltrate government departments, including intel agencies. The third and most important dimension of infiltration is that of the military, which was carried out by Al Qaeda in Pakistan in the late 1990s. It may be pertinent to mention that the last attempted terrorist attack by Al Qaeda was in 2014 in Karachi, when a group of naval officers tried to hijack a navy frigate and crash into a US ship in the open seas. Al Qaeda worked somewhat openly in Pakistan from the 1980s to 2001, and built up an elaborate network of civilian volunteers in many cities of Pakistan, who assisted in collecting funds, recruiting volunteers, and providing hideouts for the group. These sleeper cells might again be contacted by it and reactivated. Similarly, there were some Pakistani militant organisations of the 1980s, like the Harkatul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Taiba, etc, sympathetic to Al Qaeda and lying low these days. Al Qaeda may re-establish contact with them and get their support for the TTP. Finally, both the Taliban and Al Qaeda are known for their high-quality propaganda campaign. The TTP media wing lacks that finesse. In the light of guidance from the Taliban and Al Qaeda, we are likely to witness a significant improvement in the quality of propaganda. As Sun Tsu stated, “if you know your enemy and you know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles”. Sadly, it seems that Pakistan is erring in assessing the collective capabilities of the TTP, supported by the Taliban and Al Qaeda.

The net metering dead end,"LET’S start with putting a couple of undue misapprehensions to rest. I have had the opportunity of interacting with key decision-makers in the power bureaucracy and they assure me of two things. First, solar panels installed in people’s homes are not going to be taxed. Second, the net metering rate at which power utilities buy electricity back from consumers is not going to be revised downward for those who already have their system up and running. They emphasise that changes are being considered in the net metering regulations of 2015, with a view to reducing the amount people receive for the power their systems pump into the grid, but that those with existing systems will not be impacted. Let’s hope they will keep their word, because breaking covenants is becoming far too routine for the government of Pakistan. Assuming that they will keep their word with existing customers, there is another problem of a more general but critical nature. The government of Pakistan seems to no longer be able to afford the solar revolution sweeping across the world. This is somewhat striking, since the whole idea of the renewable revolution is to make electricity more affordable and cleaner and many countries have set targets for themselves on how much of their power should come from renewable sources like solar. For example, in 2010, the world’s total installed solar power generation capacity was less than 42GW, according to Our World in Data. By 2022, this had risen to 1,053GW. This is one of the fastest rates of growth for a new power source. What is even more striking than these two data points is the slope of the graph along the way, which shows continuous acceleration year after year. Rooftop solar has dominated this growth, although some estimates are suggesting that utility-scale solar may start to overtake rooftop in a few years in some critical regions, like the European Union. But these trends apart, rooftop solar has dominated the rise, and for most countries, it has been the main driving force in their solar expansion and plans to meet net zero targets. Power bureaucracies need to adapt to, facilitate and spur on the solar revolution. Here in Pakistan, something has happened that others have experienced too, but they found innovative solutions rather than trying to suppress the growth of rooftop solar. Pakistan had targeted 1,920MW of rooftop solar capacity by the year 2026, according to its latest Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan. In reality, we crossed that threshold in 2023, if not sooner. Now they want to apply the brakes, because, according to the power bureaucracy, this rapid growth in rooftop solar is creating costs that have to be passed on to poorer segments of the population, who don’t have the luxury (yet) to go the rooftop solar route because they have single-phase meters and the technology does not yet work with that. Additionally, they have very limited rooftop space they can use for the purpose. The big problem in Pakistan’s power bureaucracy now is that the state insists on setting the price of electricity manually, using outmoded formulae. In large-scale thermal power plants, for example, they still use what is called ‘cost plus’ pricing, where the regulator actually looks at each cost item in the prospective power plant and decides what their total costs are and how much margin they should be allowed. This is partly because nobody is willing to invest in Pakistan on a large scale if their returns are not guaranteed. And the big reason for that is the government of Pakistan has a lousy reputation when it comes to delivering on its commitments. Meanwhile, the way in which electricity is produced has evolved and changed rapidly from the time this ‘cost plus’ pricing formula was developed. Back then, we had a few large-scale power plants supply electricity to a single buyer — the government — which transmitted this power to various distribution companies, all state owned, who then sold it on to a list of metered customers. The solar revolution has changed all that. Now we have what is called ‘distributed generation’ or ‘point of sale consumption’, where electricity is produced in a large and growing number of locations, and often consumed then and there. Along with this shift has come a new category of consumers and producers of electricity, called ‘prosumers’ — people who produce and consume electricity themselves. The old pricing formulae are not going to work in a world of prosumers. Here is what seems to be going wrong in the power bureaucracy with this move to bring down net metering rates, and perhaps switch to what they call ‘gross metering’ for all categories, although it seems the details are still being worked out. What’s wrong with all this is that it aims to protect the bureaucracy from the disruptive impact of a new technology that is spreading rapidly around the world, and changing how power sectors are organised. Imagine, in the early 2000s, if the bureaucracy had moved to protect the Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation from the disruptive impact of mobile phones. Imagine if they made the argument that this new technology was being used by elites, who were opting out of the PTC system, leaving the rest to carry the costs of the state-owned telecom infrastructure. Imagine if the state gave in to their arguments, and moved to heavily tax handsets and talk time and priced the new technology out of the market. Where would we be today? Something similar, perhaps not identical, is happening today with solar and other renewable power generation technology. Power bureaucracies need to adapt to, facilitate and spur on this revolution and increase the speed of its adoption. The key change begins with pricing and then the ‘single buyer model’, allowing power generators to sell to their customers directly instead of through the state. Instead, they seem more concerned with protecting the financial health of their bureaucracy in the face of this revolution.

An inclusive judiciary,"ACCORDING to media reports, a recent meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was adjourned without finalising changes in its rules. This was because the law minister informed the members that the federal government was considering amending the Constitution to revise the appointment process of high court and Supreme Court (SC) judges. The government has thus far not revealed details of its proposed amendments. Some indication of possible reform can be found in the PML-N’s manifesto, which provides for an “inclusive procedure for appointment of Superior Court Judges on merit”. The PPP’s manifesto recognises the importance of diversity, and promises to increase representation for women, minorities, and underrepresented segments of society in the judiciary. The PTI’s manifesto makes similar commitments regarding making the judiciary more inclusive and the process of appointments more transparent. Importantly, the committee constituted in December 2023 to review the Judicial Commis­sion Rules, 2010, also listed “diversity” as one of the key areas that required consideration. The major parties and courts agree there is need for reform in the appointments process. It appears, therefore, that the major political parties and the courts agree there is need for reform in the appointments process to make it more inclusive and the judiciary more diverse. Specifically, a number of reforms will be required to achieve this objective. The first issue that needs to be addressed is that of framing. Often, inclusion and diversity are considered contrary to the idea of “merit”, and are reduced merely to tokenism and tick-box exercises. This perception must be strongly challenged. The inclusion of women as well as other marginalised groups in the administration of justice is a cross-cutting issue, with implications for the credibility and legitimacy of the justice system in larger society. It should be seen as an objective in itself as well as an essential pre-condition for the effective protection of human rights and substantive equality. It is now recognised that diversity is not an optional ‘extra’ but a basic component of the judiciary’s ability to do its job. And that diversity and inclusion should be considered a part of ‘merit’ and not in opposition to it. This is why a number of constitutions recognise the importance of diversity in the judiciary — specifically, greater inclusion of women — but also consideration for religious, racial and other factors, depending on the context. Any amendments to the process of judicial appointments, therefore, should expressly provide for the equal representation of women, inclusion and diversity as objectives of the judicial appointments process. Second, the composition of the JCP needs amendment. Currently, it comprises the chief justice of Pakistan, four most senior judges of the SC, one former judge of the SC, the federal law and justice minister, the attorney general of Pakistan, and a senior SC advocate. When the JCP is considering appointments for the high courts, it includes four additional members. At present, all members of the JCP are men. This is not accidental, but a consequence of the larger exclusion of women from the top echelons of the legal profession in the country. Its composition also suffers from lack of diversity and inclusion of members who are not from the judiciary or the bar. This absence has an adverse impact on the JCP’s credibility and is not sustainable. Article 175A of the Constitution should, therefore, be amended to make the JCP more diverse, and also aim to ensure that its composition broadly reflects that of larger society in terms of gender, ethnicity, religious groups, and regional balance. Third, there is currently an absence of any criteria for appointments to the SC and high courts. The Constitution only stipulates the requirement of age, citizenship, and minimum professional experience. The Judicial Commission Rules are also completely silent on the criteria on which the JCP nominates or assesses candidates. The lack of transparent and public criteria on which judicial appointments are made is incompatible with international standards and best practices on judicial appointments. Changes in the judicial appointments process should, therefore, include criteria on which candidates are considered for recommendation, and give due consideration to the need for the progressive attainment of gender equity and the removal of other historic factors of discrimination and marginalisation. The fourth issue that also has an impact on inclusion and diversity is how nominations are initiated. At present, chief justices have the sole power of ‘initiation’; ie, it is only the chief justice of the relevant court who can recommend names of candidates, who are then considered by the JCP for nominations to the parliamentary committee. This power has dubious roots, creates an unnecessary hierarchy within the JCP, and has led to the perception of misuse. In a number of jurisdictions, including the UK and South Africa, the bodies empowered to make judicial appointments invite interested candidates to apply to be considered for appointment to the Supreme Court. This model opens up the judicial appointments process, allows a more diverse range of eligible candidates to apply, and eliminates any bias, real or perceived, in the ‘initiation’ stage. The government should, therefore, consider making provision for the JCP inviting applications for vacancies in the high courts and SC. The fifth area that needs reform is lack of transparency. At present, the deliberations and proceedings of the JCP are secret and opaque. The public has no information about why certain candidates are chosen for consideration and on what basis candidates are selected for nomination. In the larger context of discriminatory practices and attitudes against women and other marginalised groups, such secrecy often works to their detriment and leads to the perception of bias in the appointments process. While the detailed deliberations of the JCP need not be made public, the reasons for selecting certain candidates for nomination must be disclosed. Most importantly, perhaps, the government’s reform package must take into consideration input from a broad range of stakeholders. Opaque and hasty attempts at such far-reaching legislation that are not consultative would defeat the very objectives of transparency, merit, and inclusion such reform claims to achieve.

Child marriages,"THE recent judgement of the Lahore High Court in ‘Azka Wahid vs Province of Punjab’ has declared the arbitrary distinction in the legally prescribed minimum age of marriage in the Punjab Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 — 18 years for men and 16 years for women — as unconstitutional. Decades of lobbying and bona fide legislative attempts in the past to correct this differentiation in the law were almost always thwarted through forceful opposition that labelled such attempts as interference with the religiously prescribed standard to determine readiness of a person for marriage — puberty, which varies greatly between males and females. However, the definition of a child in the 1929 Act is not premised on the onset of puberty, but on ages set by the legislature as per its wisdom to curtail the menace of child marriages. This non-puberty-based age prescription for marriage in the 1929 Act has on occasion been challenged before the Federal Shariat Court as un-Islamic. The FSC has, however, continued to recognise the state’s mandate to prescribe such minimum age for marriage as being in consonance with Sharia, and necessary to ensure that parties to a marriage attain the level of education, physical and intellectual development, mental maturity and economic stability important for a healthy and meaningful union. It is important to note that the FSC has not once held the gendered differential in the prescribed minimum age of marriage as religiously required. Yet, such differential has continued to subsist in our law (excepting the province of Sindh) despite repeated calls and efforts for change. The Lahore High Court’s judgement in the Azka Wahid case is then of great significance. The court has finally held that different ages prescribed for a male and female child in the 1929 Act are not based on any intelligible criterion, and violate the constitutional guarantee of equal treatment of the sexes under Article 25 of the Constitution. The court has accordingly directed the government of Punjab to issue a revised version of the law, prescribing a uniform minimum age of marriage for men and women. Such uniform prescription will make marriage laws more consistent with the definition of the age of majority under the Majority Act, 1875, the definition of a child under international law, and the legal entitlement of a citizen to exercise certain civil and political rights, such as the rights to obtain an identity card, to vote, and to enter into a contract. Almost 19m girls in Pakistan are married before they turn 18. But will the increase in the permissible age for marriage of girls to 18 years serve as a necessary deterrent to child marriages? The law already criminalises the act of marrying a minor, solemnising such marriage and, on the part of parent or guardian, permitting such marriage to take place. The criminal penalties imposed for such acts are of no deterrent import. According to Unicef, 18.9 million girls in Pakistan are married before they attain the age of 18 years; 4.6m are wedded before they turn 16 — the legally prescribed age of marriage. The real problem lies in the fact that judicial decisions on the capacity of a woman (or man) to marry adhere to the “puberty standard”, setting at naught the importance of the minimum age prescriptions in the 1929 Act. The courts have continued to hold that a marriage of a “pubert girl”, entered into with her free will, is valid notwithstanding that she is under 16 years of age. It is a legal conundrum that the criminal act of marriage to a minor has nonetheless been recognised in our law as valid. In 2022, the Isla­mabad High Court rejected the puber­­ty standard and qu­­estioned this contra­diction in our law. The court observed that the “contract of marriage by its very definition is a contract whereby the parties agree to en­­gage in sexual relations recognised by the State and society as legitimate…” The court found it nonsensical to recognise a child marriage as a valid and legal contract, when the very acts of engaging in sexually explicit conduct or sexual intercourse with a minor, notwithstanding her/ his consent, amount to sexual abuse and statutory rape under Sections 377A and 375 of the Pakistan Penal Code — marriage being no exception to criminality under the said provisions. The court went on to reason that since the very object of a contract of marriage with a child is the performance of actions that are unlawful and forbidden by law, such contracts are void, ie, of no legal effect under Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872. It is hoped that our jurisprudence grows to adopt the holistic and coherent interpretation of the law articulated by the Islamabad High Court. Such jurisprudential shift, coupled with tougher penal prescriptions in the 1929 Act, are essential to tackle the menace of child marriages. The writer is a lawyer.

Street safety,"THE Sindh chief executive’s resolve to address street crime is encouraging. This commitment raises important questions: are these crimes organised or opportunistic? Can traditional policing strategies alone be effective, or is a blend of conventional and technological methods required? How important is educating the public on safety measures for the prevention of street crime? Also, one must consider whether street crime is predominantly an urban or rural phenomenon. Street crimes typically include the snatching of mobile phones, cash, and motorcycles by individuals aged between 18 and 35. The environment, such as street lighting, architectural designs, and administrative practices, also plays a significant role in these incidents. Although initially appearing to be opportunistic, these crimes are increasingly becoming organised, driven by environmental and situational factors. They usually occur in densely populated and economically disadvantaged areas, particularly where there is minimal surveillance, such as lack of CCTV, private security, and alarm systems. Several factors contribute to the rise in street crime, including high unemployment rates, poverty, easy access to small arms, a low criminal conviction rate, enticing high-value items, insufficient police presence, low CCTV coverage, weak police-community collaboration, and limited public knowledge on safety practices. Hiring unverified labourers and domestic workers in urban areas like Karachi also plays a role. The psychological impact is significant, leading to increased feelings of insecurity and a rise in mental health issues among residents. Recent reports indicate a significant surge in street crime in Karachi, with daily occurrences of theft and violence. However, lengthy processes and low trust between police and the public often prevent victims from reporting crimes. Streamlining the process for registering FIRs could enhance public trust and provide more accurate crime data. Karachi Police, with a force of 44,000 personnel, dedicates only 13,500 to patrol duties, with the remainder assigned to non-patrol roles. This distribution poses challenges in effectively managing street crime, as traditional policing methods often result in unsuccessful investigations. Karachi’s unchecked demographic changes have led to the unregulated growth of slums, necessitating the establishment of a ‘Slums Regulatory Authority’ to oversee these areas and ensure proper integration of newcomers from other cities with collaboration between union councils, police, and Nadra. To effectively prevent crime such as auto theft and ATM robberies, improvements in vehicle security, increased surveillance around ATMs, and greater police visibility are essential. To address such challenges in Pakistan, the police introduced the Ababeel, Mujahid, Shaheen, and Dolphin squads, but public expectations require a more proactive approach and technological backup. Traditional policing methods may result in faulty investigations. International examples, such as Malaysia’s successful strategies, can offer valuable insights. These include enhanced police visibility, identifying crime hotspots, and fostering police-community partnerships, which have proven effective in improving public safety and reducing crime rates. To effectively combat street crime, the police should harness advanced technologies like AI, CCTV and mobile apps to detect crime and aid their prevention. Facial and licence plate recognition are key to identifying and managing offenders, while GPS tracking is invaluable for recovering stolen vehicles and monitoring taxis. However, relying solely on technology is not enough to re­­duce street crime. Effective law en­­forcement and ac­­tive communi­­ty engagement are equally crucial. Police need increased mobility, and the mo­­torcycle busin­ess, including vehicle registration, requires stringent regulation. Initiatives like Safe City projects should be launched in major cities such as Karachi to enhance urban security. As most street crimes occur after sunset, identifying and reinforcing hotspots with security and lightingand public education on safety are imperative. Improving the justice system is essential to addressing inefficiencies and corruption. Enhancing investigation quality, prosecution, and witness cooperation is vital for increasing conviction rates. Citizen education regarding the safe use of mobiles, safe car parking, using ATMs, etc, should be part of urban policing. For this purpose, all capital police departments in Pakistan should initiate citizen-police education initiatives, including through distance learning. A holistic approach involving technology, community engagement, political will, professional policing, and responsible citizenry is necessary to deter and defeat street crime.

IMF mission to meet Pakistani authorities next week to discuss ‘next phase of engagement’: official,"An International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission will meet Pakistani authorities next week to discuss the “next phase of engagement”, an official from the international money lender said on Sunday. Speaking to Dawn.com, Esther Perez Ruiz, the Fund’s resident representative for Pakistan, said: “A mission team led by Nathan Porter, IMF’s mission chief to Pakistan, will meet with authorities next week to discuss the next phase of engagement. “The aim is to lay the foundation for better governance and stronger, more inclusive, and resilient economic growth that will benefit all Pakistanis,” she added. Pakistan last month completed a short-term $3 billion programme, which helped stave off sovereign default, but the government has stressed the need for a fresh, longer-term programme. Last week, the Fund said that a mission was expected to visit Pakistan this month to “discuss the FY25 budget, policies, and reforms under a potential new programme for the welfare of all Pakistanis”. Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the $350bn economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high 38pc last May. The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around 2pc this year compared to negative growth last year. Pakistan is expected to seek at least $6bn and request additional financing from the Fund under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust. On Friday, the Fund said that downside risks for the economy remain exceptionally high. “Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” said the IMF in its staff report following the second and final review under the standby agreement. The Fund added that political complexities and high cost of living could weigh on policy, adding that policy slippages, together with lower external financing, could undermine the narrow path to debt sustainability and place pressure on the exchange rate. The IMF also said higher commodity prices and disruptions to shipping, or tighter global financial conditions, would also adversely affect external stability for the cash-strapped nation. The fund stressed the need for timely post-programme external financing disbursements.

"No such thing as strategic state-owned enterprises, says Finance Minister Aurangzeb","Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Sunday said that there was “no such thing” as strategic state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as he stressed the need for privatisation. He made the remarks at a pre-budget conference in Lahore, two days after  Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the government would limit its business only to strategic and essential SOEs under its domain but their number would be reduced from 40 after scrutiny. Chairing the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) meeting, which was attended by the finance minister, Dar said privatisation of loss-making SOEs would be a priority. The meeting noted that 40 SOEs were currently categorised as strategic or essential, but respective ministries would submit their details to the Cabinet Committee on State-Owned Enterprises (CCoSOE). The CCoSOE will determine the status of the SOEs to be categorised as strategic or essential entities. Speaking on Sunday, Aurangzeb said: “There is no such as [a] strategic SOE.” Talking about the meeting chaired by Dar on Friday, he continued, “We are absolutely on the same wavelength — that there is no such thing as a strategic SOE.” The finance minister said that a meeting would be held tomorrow where “we will go back to various ministries and say that all this should be handed over to the private sector”. “There will be public-private partnership and we will accelerate the privatisation agenda,” he said. Commenting on concerns regarding the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Aurangzeb said the government was not just looking at foreign investors. “They are local and foreign investors who are bidding […] there is no such thing that we are only looking at foreign investors,” he said. Commenting on a fresh loan programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, he said that a larger and longer programme was needed to bring “permanence in macroeconomic stability and structural reforms”. He also talked about energy reforms, saying that there were “leakages” and stressed the need for stopping theft. He said that changes were being brought to the boards of distribution companies (Discos) in order to bring in those from the private sector for “better corporate governance”. “And then you will see how we bring those Discos towards concessions or privatisation or a combination of both,” he emphasised.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1833050/no-such-thing-as-strategic-state-owned-enterprises-says-finance-minister-aurangzeb
ADB links support with IMF’s clean chit," “Given my interactions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the dialogue decisiveness of the current government, I feel very hopeful that there will be a successor programme from the Fund,” said the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) Country Director for Pakistan Yong Ye in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of ADB’s 57th Annual Meeting in Tbilisi this week. Tacitly indicating that support from ADB would only be possible with a clean chit from the Fund, Mr Ye expressed cautious optimism for the economy. Highlighting the uncertainties from last year, Mr Ye termed the IMF agreement announced in June as a ‘miracle’. Since then, however, he said, the caretaker government did a good job stabilising the economy under the Fund’s Stand-By Arrangement. More importantly, he added, with the IMF agreement in place, the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased from $4.4 billion to over $9bn in the week ending on May 3. “While the country may still be in the ICU, its immediate liquidity crisis has been sorted, and default has been avoided. This has given some confidence to the markets,” he said. Record highs of PSX Commenting on the frequent new highs of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Mr Ye observed that previously, when the eurobond payment was due, there had been a lot of hype in the media with speculations about whether the country would be able to repay or default. “Such pieces did not induce courage and the markets started fluctuating, contributing to a fluctuating exchange rate.” Bank’s top official says Pakistan has sorted out immediate liquidity crisis, but still in ICU This time around, in April, when the $1bn eurobond payment was due, it was paid without fanfare, indicating much better market confidence. Other positive indicators, such as a narrowing external account deficit and recovering remittances, have also improved investor confidence. However, fiscal deficit challenges remain. One major reason behind them is the high interest rate and high debt servicing burden. ‘Act on what you know’ “In my first meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, he showed his commitment to implementing and acting on reforms,” said Mr Ye. Pakistan does not need more economic prescriptions, he said, agreeing with the finance minister’s recent statements. He said the general perception is that Pakistan knows what it needs to do but never does it. “Act on what you know needs to be done.” He emphasised that the ADB management wants to be with the government in this difficult time. The agency understands the need to ensure that the debt is sustainable rather than an added burden that does not remove the constraints the country is facing. While the economy is recovering, there is still uncertainty moving forward. The removal of this uncertainty depends very much on the government’s commitment and ability to implement economic and structural reforms. A special arrangement Mr Ye emphasised the importance of investment in reviving the economy and the role the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) could play. “My understanding of SIFC is that it is a special arrangement to attract foreign direct investment from some targeted countries,” he said. From the ADB’s point of view, while the SIFC may be a quick short-term solution, Pakistan still needs to look for long-term systematic solutions to attract foreign direct investment. This would require an overall enabling environment with improved regulations and transparency. Given past unsuccessful incidents such as Reko Diq, SIFC, at least in the short run, can demonstrate the country’s potential and ability for investment, which can then be further broadened for other countries. An important element in attracting FDI is the ability of firms to repatriate profit out of the country. At the moment, investors may believe that while earning money in Pakistan is possible, repatriating profits is challenging. Non-productivity of real estate The country needs to increase its revenue and rationalise expenditures, Mr Ye remarked. As an example, he highlights the real estate sector where a lot of savings are invested. The real estate sector is “just financial addition with no value addition. If the country invests in its natural resources instead, the country will start rolling,” he said. Inflation is on a downward trend, and if this trend continues, the monetary policy rate will come down, Mr Ye opinioned, resulting in a smaller burden of debt servicing and more fiscal room. This will also unlock the investment and borrowing by the private sector, he hoped. Since there is a lot of pent-up investment demand during the period of high interest rates, Pakistan may enter into a boom cycle when the rates start coming down. But for the revival to be sustainable, ‘it all comes back to reforms’,’ he said. Remaining pledges While ADB was among the institutions that pledged support after the disastrous floods of 2022, almost the entire amount has yet to be disbursed. ADB had pledged about $1.5bn, of which only $108.79 million has been released according to a media report, with a further $340.9m expected this year. In response to why there has been a delay, Mr Ye said that the amount pledged was for reconstruction and that the process cannot be rushed. “The damages have to be assessed along with the ground realities, keeping in mind the new climate risk profile and the possibility that these areas may be flooded again,” he said. Pointing out that water was still standing in some areas till the start of this year, Mr Ye said that the new climate risk profile needs to be assessed before the feasibility study. Some roads need to be redesigned, followed by the procurement process, contract award, and finally, disbursement. The entire process is lengthy. Mr Ye identified several critical areas for Pakistan’s long-term economic growth. These include controlling inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and diversifying the export base.

Areas of cooperation with Saudi Arabia identified: PM Shehbaz,"PRIME Minister Shehbaz Sharif has termed Pakistan’s recent diplomatic deliberations with Saudi Arabia “great progress”, Geo News reported. In an interview with Arab news channel Al Arabiya English, the premier said, “We have identified areas of mutual cooperation, both at the government-to-government and business-to-business levels and that have been clearly identified. We now have a clear-cut way forward.” The PM highlighted that both countries would work on mutual cooperation and investments in the field of mines and minerals as well as renewable energy, among other fields. The interview comes days after a Saudi investors’ delegation visited Pakistan.  The premier spoke about his maiden visit to the kingdom after starting his new term as the country’s chief executive. He also mentioned the visits made by the Saudi government and business delegations to strengthen diplomatic and trade ties between the two nations. PM Shehbaz said his meetings with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman were positive. In response to a question, the premier termed the recent Pak-Saudi investment conference “very productive and fruitful”. While sharing details of his vision for economic stability, the PM mentioned his recent visit to the kingdom to attend the World Economic Forum meetings in which the discussions revolved around increasing agricultural production in Pakistan with the help of modern equipment and technology.

Exports to Europe fall despite GSP+,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s expo­rts to European countries declined 6.27 per cent in the first nine months of the current fiscal year. Exports to the European Union states have begun to dip in the current fiscal year despite a GSP+ status that allows most Pakistani goods a duty-free entrance into European markets. In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan, to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on exports to Europe. In absolute terms, Pakistan’s exports to the EU dipped to $6.105bn in 9MFY24 from $6.27bn in the corresponding months of last year. According to figures compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan, the decline was mainly due to reduced demand for Pakistani goods in western, southern, and northern Europe. In FY23, exports to the EU dropped 4.41pc to $8.188bn from $8.566bn in the preceding fiscal year. Western Europe, which includes countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy and Belgium, accounts for the largest portion of Pakistan’s exports to the EU. However, exports to this region have significantly decreased by 12pc. The export value stood at $2.947bn in the first nine months of FY24, down from $3.353bn during the same period last year. While exports to western, southern, and northern Europe have declined, there is a silver lining in the form of an uptick in exports to Eastern Europe. The exports saw an increase of 8.38pc to $466.19m in 9MFY24, up from $430.14m in the corresponding months last year. Exports to southern Europe declined 1.24pc to $2.216bn in 9MFY24 from $2.244bn in the corresponding period last year. In this region, exports to Spain grew 3.73pc to $1.084 in 9MFY24 from $1.045bn last year. Exports to Italy declined 3.22pc to $825.44m in 9MFY24, compared to $852.93 m in the same period last year. However, exports to northern Europe witnessed a 2.31pc dip. The export value to this region stood at $475.92m, down from $487.19m in the corresponding period last year. Before Brexit, Pakistan’s major export destination was the United Kingdom. In the post-Brexit period, Pakistan’s exports to the UK slightly went up to $1.529bn in 9MFY24 from $1.494bn over the corresponding period of last year, indicating an increase of 2.34pc. In FY23, Pakistan’s exports dipped by 10.63pc to $1.966bn to the UK from $2.20bn in the same period of the preceding year. The British government, however, has assured Islamabad that there will be no change in the post-Brexit scenario, as evident from Pakistan’s inclusion in its preferential market access scheme.

"Fight till the last ball, PCB chief tells cricket team in Dublin","Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Sunday told the national team to “fight till the last ball” ahead of the second match of a three-match T20 series against Ireland. As he met players of the men’s national team in the Irish capital of Dublin, the PCB quoted him as saying: “Fight till the last ball; the competition should be apparent.”  On Friday, Ireland recorded their maiden T20 win against Pakistan who could not defend a solid-looking 182-5 after being put in to bat first, dealing a shocking blow to the Babar Azam-led side’s preparations for the World Cup, which is taking place next month in the United States. The loss to Ireland, who are in Pakistan’s group in the T20 World Cup, came after a series draw on home soil to a New Zealand squad missing most of their first-choice players. With Babar only recently reinstated as captain, it was another bump in the road for their tournament preparation.  Today’s match will start at 7pm, with Ireland leading the series by 1-0. In a post on X, the PCB shared a video of Naqvi meeting the Green Shirts and speaking to them, adding that a detailed discussion on the action plan took place during the two-hour-long meetup. Encouraging the team, the PCB chairman urged the players to play with hard work, passion and a “professional approach”. He noted that T20 cricket needed a unique and aggressive approach, adding that victory was only possible if cricket was played in a “modern manner”. “An action plan can be formulated while sitting in a room but the real test is on the ground, where the performance should be visible,” the PCB quoted him as telling the team. Naqvi praised all players as “undoubtedly talented, professional and the best”, adding that the team’s bowling attack was “splendid”. However, he emphasised that great attention was required when fielding so that the opponent “cannot get any chance” to score. “The players are the hope for Pakistan and you have to meet the nation’s expectations. Teamwork is the fundamental thing for victory,” the PCB chairman said. He noted that the public loved cricket and had expectations from the team. Naqvi said that success would come if all 11 of the players in the team performed with unity. “No one is accepting the loss in the first match against Ireland. The real test after Ireland and England is the World Cup,” he added.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1833052/fight-till-the-last-ball-pcb-chief-tells-cricket-team-in-dublin
FIFA’S FOUL ON PAKISTAN FOOTBALL,"Apathy, manipulation and intrigue seem to define Pakistan football. While players and fans of football continue to rue the state of the sport in the country despite its undoubted popularity, the machinations in its governing body, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF), paint a picture of those at the helm working for their own personal interests rather than for the good of its main stakeholders. But now there seems to be an unholy nexus between such interests and parts of the global football governing body Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) as well. FIFA has suspended the country twice in the last decade alone — including over interference in the PFF elections. Eventually, the world governing body resorted to a stopgap solution of appointing a “Normalisation Committee” (NC) in 2019. It was given the explicit task to hold the PFF elections transparently, while managing football activities, including conducting regular domestic football tournaments, till the appointment of a new governing board.  But even this stopgap solution has now been mired in controversy, with the NC failing woefully short of meeting its mandate and getting multiple extensions to its tenure along the way. One major criticism against this stopgap NC is that the man steering it — Pakistani-Canadian tech entrepreneur Haroon Malik — is trying to set up a franchise league, on similar lines as cricket’s glitzy Pakistan Super League, at the expense of a club-based domestic league necessary for the grassroots development of the sport. This Eos investigation will reveal how Malik is actively trying to engineer a situation that would enable him to continue exerting his influence over the PFF — even after his departure following elections for a new governing body — and how some of the highest-ranking officials in FIFA are part of an elaborate scheme to upend Pakistan football for their own gains. Everyone agrees that Pakistan football needs a regular league system to provide a platform for local footballers and to capitalise on the growing fan interest in the sport. But is a franchise system like cricket’s PSL the best way forward? And why is an interim football administration pushing for it? FAR FROM NORMALISED On a breezy Ramazan night during the second week of March, two football teams took to a ground nestled in the hills to Karachi’s north. There was an extravagant ceremony before the match, with fireworks aplenty.  It was the opening match of the Ramazan Gold Cup. Sights like these have become few and far between in Pakistan football and the PFF had nothing to do with it. This tournament had been organised privately, with domestic football activity having become non-existent in the country. The Pakistan Premier Football League (PPFL), the country’s top-tier competition, hasn’t been held by the PFF since 2018. It’s something that has irked Pakistan’s history-making head coach Stephen Constantine. Constantine — who has been demanding that the league be restarted — wasn’t in attendance at the Naya Nazimabad Football Stadium, however. The 61-year-old Englishman was in Lahore, overseeing the national team’s preparations for its upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan. A day earlier in Lahore, Constantine was visibly irate during an interaction with reporters. Peppered with questions regarding Pakistan’s chances against Jordan — who had recently ended as runners-up in the Asian Cup — the English coach was blunt and unforgiving. Time and again, Constantine has reiterated that it is fundamentally important that Pakistan revives its league structure, which can allow local players to have regular competition. Since taking up the job in October 2023, Constantine has been adamant that a functioning league would allow him to have a greater pool of local players to choose from, instead of working only with those at his disposal at the training camp. He was merely repeating himself six months on. He was also critical of the stopgap NC over the delay in organising the National Challenge Cup, an annual month-long football tournament, which was suspended after the group stages in January last year. For him, the tournament could have been a starting point for the league. “I just heard there were 5,000 clubs in Pakistan,” he said, referring to the results of the recent club scrutiny — disputed at several levels — carried out by the stopgap NC. “You don’t need every district to be part of the league. We had a Challenge Cup with 32 teams. Just take 16 teams from it and start the bloody league.” What Constantine doesn’t know is that the PFF’s internal problems aren’t the only impediment to the revival and resumption of the domestic league. More than a year before his appointment as the chairman of the FIFA appointed ‘Normalisation Committee’ in December 2021, Haroon Malik visited the FIFA headquarters in Zurich for a ‘secret meeting’ that would determine the future trajectory of Pakistan football. GAMING THE SYSTEM To be fair, Pakistan football suffers from a multitude of problems: from a decades-long power struggle over control of the federation, including a hostile takeover of its premises in 2021 — which resulted in a 15-month suspension of Pakistan by FIFA — to the lack of clarity over whether any future domestic league would be a club or departmental event, or if it would take place at all. This is aside from national team players often going unpaid for months, and the country’s and clubs’ abysmal performance in international competitions.  The PFF has also failed on the administrative front, with elections for the new governing body not held in the three years since Malik was appointed to lead the stopgap NC. One of the elections conducted by the stopgap NC, for the referee’s association, remains disputed. In another controversial decision, the PFF allowed newly registered clubs the right to vote — against the PFF Constitution — in the ongoing district elections. These clubs were scrutinised as part of PFF’s extensive programme to register clubs, the long-delayed first step towards holding elections. A novel way of voting has also been introduced for the district elections, with votes to be cast through WhatsApp, which has raised further alarm among the footballing community. There’s a method to the madness, however. Under the PFF constitution, registered clubs vote for district associations, which in turn vote for the provincial associations. Three nominees each from the four provinces and one from Islamabad become part of the PFF Executive Committee (ExCo). The ExCo, comprising a total of 26 members, votes for the president. Other relevant associations and groups, like that of the referees, also have one vote as do the eight departmental teams and the club that wins the women’s national championship. With a simple majority required to win, support from the provinces and Islamabad alone can tip the election in a candidate’s favour. With clubs — that had voting rights previously, when the last PFF election was held in 2015 — set to vote for the stakeholders who have been vying for power for the past several years, detractors have accused the NC of manipulating the still-to-be-held elections by including newly registered clubs. The extent of the control the Haroon Malik-led governing body holds over the election has resulted in concerns over transparency. In the meantime, the government has written to FIFA on multiple occasions, most recently in December, calling for a change in the NC over its failure to hold elections within the prescribed time. Despite the vociferous complaints, FIFA gave Haroon Malik and his team another nine-month extension, in March this year. To understand why Malik continues to enjoy FIFA’s unwavering support and patronage, we have to rewind back to a year before Malik’s appointment as the NC chairman in January 2021. In retrospect, this provided the first glimpse of what was at play and how FIFA was committing the biggest foul on Pakistan football. Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league, only came to light after he was forced out
of the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. Pakistan head coach Stephen Constantine with his players during a training session at the Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium in Islamabad in November 2023: the Englishman has repeatedly expressed his frustration over the lack of regular domestic football in the country | White Star THE MOVERS AND SHAKERS OF PAKISTAN FOOTBALL On a cold December afternoon in 2019, Haroon Malik posed for a picture outside the FIFA headquarters in Zurich. “Discussing Pakistan football! Invigorating meetings, exciting times!” he captioned the picture on X, then known as Twitter. The discussions that took place in the Swiss city on that day would shape the future of Pakistan football. Plans for it had been set in motion months before. In August 2019, a month before FIFA first announced the NC for the PFF, global professional services firm KPMG had begun reaching out to people with knowledge of Pakistan football. During its initial correspondence, the KPMG Football Benchmark department said that it had started “an exciting project on football in Pakistan for a prominent client.” When discussions began, it emerged that it wanted to discuss the holding of a franchise league in Pakistan. Around that same time, a Facebook page was launched by the name of Football Club Pakistan (FCPK). Those working for the page aimed at providing football updates and were employed by media communications company Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan — the Pakistan branch of Starcom, which is headquartered in Chicago and which, in turn, is a subsidiary of global marketing and communication giants Publicis Groupe. FCPK was Malik’s first foray into Pakistan football. Some 15 months after FCPK was launched, the Canadian-Pakistani tech entrepreneur was named the chairman of the PFF Normalisation Committee, following the resignation of his predecessor Humza Khan. But it is what Malik was doing in those intervening months that made his appointment one that raises issues of conflict of interest. A FOOTBALLING CHESSBOARD Back in 2019, leading the discussions on that “exciting project on football in Pakistan” was KPMG’s former sports advisory manager, Yacine Sosse Alaoui. Alaoui has since left KPMG, joining FIFA as its business intelligence manager in September 2020. But a little over six months earlier, in February 2020, Alaoui and Andrea Sartori, the head of KPMG Football Benchmark, had accompanied Malik for a trip to Kuala Lumpur, where they met with officials from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) about what Malik called “discussing opportunities and ideas for Pakistan football.” Malik had not been named as head of the NC at that time. “Haroon Malik came to the AFC in 2020 with people from KPMG,” a source in Asian football’s governing body told Eos. “Discussions with the marketing department centred on a competition.” When the AFC was asked about that visit, a spokesperson of Asia’s football governing body termed it “a courtesy visit.” In fact, it was the December 2019 meeting in Zurich that had reportedly set up discussions with the AFC. The FIFA headquarters is a seven-storey building: two floors above ground and five underground. It was a closed-doors secret meeting on one of those levels that would script the future of Pakistan football. In alleged attendance alongside Sartori, Alaoui and Malik were Mario Gallavotti, the Italian lawyer who heads FIFA’s independent committees; Romy Gai, the chairman of London-based sports industry operators AWE International Group; and Pakistani advertising mogul Raihan Merchant. The proposal was laid out for holding a franchise league in Pakistan with Gallavotti and Gai — who would in 2022 become FIFA’s chief business officer — on board. Their interests remain unknown, but the talk in FIFA at that time was “that something big was going to happen in Pakistan football.” Sartori, Gai and Gallavotti are all Italian. When FIFA was approached for comment in 2022 regarding that meeting, its spokesperson gave a stern reply: “Please be informed that there are no updates regarding the matter you’ve mentioned.” The world football body did not comment on whether Gallavotti and Gai were part of that meeting, although they did not deny it either. Meanwhile Merchant, when contacted by Eos, denied his presence at the meeting. A source close to the discussion, however, says otherwise: “They [Gallavotti and Gai] were really pushing for the league to happen,” the source told Eos. “The purpose of the meeting seemed to push for its endorsement.” It was clear that Malik and his associates didn’t want to come out as rebels. They wanted to hold the league with the PFF’s blessings, as part of the domestic calendar, but also as sole holders of all rights for the event. Football was going to be the third sports discipline Z2C Limited — the holding company for ventures owned by Merchant, which also has Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan, now Brainchild Communications — was going to organise a league for. Malik has been an executive director at Z2C since January 2019 — a position he still holds. Merchant and Malik also are alumni of the same university. Malik’s FCPK would become the ideal social media tool to propagate the league. Meanwhile, Z2C also had BSports — a sports app that combined social and data feeds with a livestream of sports events. It also had digital rights for the Pakistan Super League. The question being raised is whether Malik’s interest is in putting the affairs of the PFF in order as head of the NC or to push forward the franchise league he is invested in. Haroon Malik’s Instagram post showing him at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich on December 5, 2019, more than a year before his appointment by FIFA as the NC chairman | Instagram/roon.toon FIFA’S ROLE While giving another nine-month extension to Haroon Malik and his team till March 2024 — originally the NC had been appointed in September 2019 till June 2020, while Haroon was appointed the NC chairman in January 2021, for a nine-month period — FIFA had warned of possible sanctions being imposed if PFF elections weren’t held by then. But despite little headway being made and multiple deadlines being missed, FIFA has once again extended its mandate till December 2024. “Of course, it’s those links high up in FIFA,” one source close to the matter tells Eos. “With Haroon there, the franchise league plan stays alive.” In the meantime, most former Starcom employees are now working for the PFF, a simple LinkedIn search will show. Hasnain Haider, PFF’s head of digital media, was a project manager at Starcom. PFF’s football performance analyst, Irtaza Hussain, was community manager for FCPK at Starcom. PFF’s current creative manager, Haider Ali, was formerly at Z2C. While the NC has been unable to pay dues to players of the national teams because of an audit objection raised by FIFA, the employees continue to get paid by funds coming in from the global football body. “The PFF is effectively being run by Starcom,” a source in the NC tells Eos. “The groundwork is being laid for the franchise league they want to hold.” Malik, though, hasn’t been the only one looking to organise a football league in Pakistan. UK-based TouchSky Group, Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Peshawar Zalmi owner Javed Afridi and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa football official Shahid Shinwari have all publicly stated their intentions of doing so as well. TouchSky, later rebranded as Global Soccer Ventures and now repackaged as Pakistan Football League, is set to unveil its franchise league next month. It has set a date of November 1 to hold its franchise league which, contrary to the brochures it has been sending out, does not have the endorsement of the English Premier League or its clubs. But with the PFF having the final say over any league, Haroon’s position as the NC chief, which will see him hold elections for a new executive committee of the country’s football governing body, means there is a conflict of interest, even if he says that FIFA doesn’t think there is any. “Anyone associated with football, anywhere in the world, would have some stake in the game,” Haroon told Eos in April 2021. “It is normal, and natural. You cannot have someone who knows nothing about football, nothing about the market that they are operating in, and be responsible for football. Employers determine if conflict of interests are potentially troublesome. FIFA determined that my commercial interests have no conflict with this role [as NC chief]. If FIFA is okay, then that is the final word.” In fact, FIFA did not specifically comment on Haroon’s commercial interests having a conflict with his role, but its spokesperson said that “in line with standard procedures, all members of the Normalisation Committee were subject to stringent eligibility checks.” The spokesperson did not disclose whether FIFA had knowledge of Haroon’s elaborate plans of holding a league, or whether they were investigated during the eligibility checks, but added: “FIFA has no further comment at this stage.”  TAKING INSPIRATION FROM THE PSL In 2015, Z2C helped launch the PSL. Its affiliate, Blitz Advertising, was a broadcasting, live-streaming and a marketing partner for the league. But the partnership fell apart due to a legal dispute in 2020, with the Pakistan Cricket Board claiming victory in its arbitration proceedings against Blitz over rights fee payments related to the PSL two years later. Blitz has long harboured hopes of holding a football league on similar lines. With football being an untapped market in Pakistan, with massive potential returns for the initiators, they aren’t the only ones. For some time, Badar “Bobby” Refaie, the former director marketing of the PCB, seemed to be driving forward Z2C’s football ambitions externally, even though he brushed it off as small talk in a conversation during a PSL match in 2021. “They just can’t get it together,” he said. Badar has been involved in almost every sport — from organising a tour of hockey legends to Pakistan to the National Volleyball Championships.  “Working on new ideas, beside PSL for your Sports projects [sic],” he wrote to Merchant on a Facebook post in March 2019, adding three pictures: a group photo of former hockey stars with the chief of army staff, one of himself alongside squash great Jahangir Khan and another of Spanish football legend Carles Puyol waving to crowds at the National Stadium in Karachi, during the final of the 2019 PSL. Puyol’s visit to Karachi was part of a series of launch events for the World Soccer Stars which, in November 2019, saw him, Brazilian Kaka, Portuguese Luis Figo and Frenchman Nicolas Anelka play two exhibition matches in Pakistan. Ahead of the PSL final in March that year, TouchSky — who were also behind the World Soccer Stars event — had inked a deal with the PFF, which was elected in 2018 following elections conducted on the orders of the Supreme Court and not recognised by FIFA, to organise two leagues: a franchise league and a rebranded version of the Pakistan Premier Football League. The deal, and their plans, came crashing down when FIFA appointed the NC to oversee football affairs in Pakistan. TouchSky tried to do a similar deal with the PFF NC of Haroon’s predecessor Humza Khan, but were rebuffed.  ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES? Haroon Malik’s and Z2C’s plans had already taken off the ground by then. Visits to both AFC and FIFA had been completed. And once Humza Khan resigned, Malik’s path to take up the reins of the NC was cleared — thanks to support from Gallavotti, one of FIFA president Gianni Infantino’s key advisers. But Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league — only came to light after he was forced out of the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, Ashfaq Hussain Shah, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. That forcible takeover of PFF headquarters by Shah eventually saw FIFA ban Pakistan for 15 months. Malik aired his views on franchise leagues after FIFA and UEFA crushed plans for a breakaway European Super League (ESL), which was in many ways akin to the franchise system common in American sports. “Looking at our club structures and history, there are multiple options here,” Malik expressed on X, while delving into a discussion on the collapsed ESL. “A hybrid model transitioning into promotion/relegation makes sense to me. [America’s] Major League Soccer, [Japan’s] J-League is a good conversation starter.” Malik expanded on this: “So many possibilities. Bottom line — either one is good for the players! Get them playing! Enablers: Fandom, Partnerships and Broadcast. Not insurmountable!” When asked why a traditional league model — which would see the country’s football club culture thrive — might not be better than a franchise league model for Pakistan, Haroon replied, “We are a ways away from club licensing, and regulations get stringent everywhere.” However, franchise leagues run for a short period of time, with little time to invest in grassroots football or academies. Club football, on the other hand, runs through the calendar year, giving players the opportunity to get regular competitive football. Moreover, club-based leagues have the system of relegation and promotion, which operate on sporting merit, while franchise leagues are closed competitions. The Major League Soccer (MLS) — a franchise league system — has achieved huge popularity in the United States. The MLS, however, runs like a regular league, filling up a calendar year. In India, the Indian Super League had to eventually be expanded for it to become the country’s national league. Its current season, which began in September, will culminate in May. Another concern is that franchise teams will take up a sizeable chunk of whatever sponsorship is on offer, leaving nothing for the clubs to fund their programmes. This is already a problem for Pakistani club sides. With the PPFL largely made up of departments, and with none of the teams fulfilling AFC’s club licensing regulations, Pakistan has been unable to send a representative to continental competitions. Malik, however, believes that wouldn’t be a concern for potential team owners in the model suggested by him. “Setting up the commercial model is key, adapted to our local market and the sporting culture here,” he said during that exchange. “Once that is done, everything is like Tetris, blocks falling into place.” Malik’s conviction at that point seemingly stemmed from the fact that his plans were already underway, with FCPK set to take care of fandom and Z2C, with its huge portfolio of clients, making sure of partnerships and broadcast. But the FIFA suspension broke that acceleration. When Malik and members of his NC eventually returned after being handed back the PFF premises that had been taken over and the FIFA ban getting lifted in June 2022, they were given a further year to complete the mandate. The NC was then given another extension until March 2024 and now has until December to complete the process. Meanwhile, detractors insist that the extensions are part of a larger plan to consolidate Malik’s control of the election process and the federation. TIME TO TURN A CORNER Such control over the election is key to bringing the league plan of Malik’s Z2C, Gallavotti and Gai to fruition. If a candidate they’re backing comes into power, it would be easier to get the league rubber-stamped. It would also ensure that the new PFF will effectively be run by former employees of Z2C. “Gallavotti and Gai are part of FIFA’s inner circle, closest to Infantino,” one source in the global football body tells Eos. “If they want the league to happen, it will happen sooner or later.” FIFA’s aim of appointing the NC was to have transparent elections of the PFF but that now seems to be turning into, in footballing terms, a red card offence. The global football body can point to the fact that it was during the NC’s tenure that Pakistan got past the first round of World Cup qualifying for the first time in history. But, even if the league eventually begins, the damage caused to the country’s domestic football scene during the last few years is unforgivable. Earlier this year, the NC made a point of degrading three top-tier clubs of the country. When the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) asked for nominees from Pakistan for the inaugural SAFF Club Championship, the NC shortlisted three clubs from Balochistan — Afghan FC, Muslim FC and Baloch FC — for the event. A tournament between the trio was announced to select Pakistan’s representative, but it never took place, as the clubs baulked at the financial guarantees the NC sought from them beforehand. The NC later stated that the clubs weren’t interested in participating at the SAFF event. It goes back to what Malik said in that exchange on X about clubs not coming close to meeting licensing regulations. Constantine, if he stays that long, will in all probability get a league for his players, but it may not be a club-based one. As far as the clubs in the country are concerned, their fate seems to have been sealed by those in FIFA’s inner circle. The writer is Dawn’s Sports Editor.

"Bednarek storms to 200m triumph in Doha, Neeraj Chopra falls short","DOHA: Kenneth Bednarek sounded out a warning to his Olympic rivals with a personal best and world-leading time in the 200 metres when he led an all-American podium at the Diamond League meeting in windy conditions in Doha on Friday. Wearing a headband with the words  “Fear no one”, Bednarek was in lane seven but the Tokyo Olympics silver medallist stormed to the finish line with a time of 19.67 seconds. Courtney Lindsey finished second (20.01), while Kyree King (20.21) was third. “The best I can do this year is gold medal in the Olympics... I know I have the talent and good training. Running this fast this early is really good, it means I will be fast by the time we start the Olympics,” Bednarek said. In the women’s 100 met­res, Britain’s Daryll Neita edged ahead of American Tamari Davis in the final 15 metres to win by one-hundredth of a second in a photo finish for the podium. Neita won with a time of 10.98 while American Cel­era Barnes was third (11.02). But it was Alison dos Santos who got the crowd going when he broke the meet record in the 400m hurdles as the towering Brazilian left his opponents far behind to clock 46.86 seconds. In the men’s long jump, Greece’s reigning Olympic champion Miltiadis Tentoglou finished second behind Jamaica’s Carey McLeod who won with a leap of 8.52 metres thanks to a strong tailwind. Tentoglou, who was competing in his first event this year, could only manage 8.36 on his final attempt. India’s Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra was pipped to top spot in the javelin by the Czech Republic’s Jakub Vadlejch in a close contest where the pair were separated by just two centimetres. Chopra was looking to beat Vadlejch’s best throw of 88.38 metres but his final effort fell agonisingly short as the two athletes smiled and shook hands. Elsewhere, Tokyo 2020 gold medallist Steven Gardiner said he was  “just where I wanted to be” after a dominant 400m win at Qatar Sports Club Stadium. And Kenyan world title-holder Mary Moraa held off Britain’s Jemma Reekie to win the women’s 800m by half a second in 1:57.91, her season’s best. Kenya’s Brian Komen came out narrowly ahead of compatriots Timothy Cheruiyot — the former world champion and Tokyo 2020 silver-medallist — and Reynold Kipkorir Cheruiyot with 3:32.43 in the men’s 1,500m. In the women’s pole vault, Britain’s world indoor champion Molly Caudery won on countback against reigning world champion Nina Kennedy of Australia after they both cleared 4.73.

Real Madrid eagerly awaits Mbappe after PSG exit confirmed,"MADRID: Excitement is soaring with the mercury in the sunny streets of the Spanish capital as Real Madrid fans await the arrival of French striker Kylian Mbappe. The Paris St Germain forward confirmed Friday he is leaving the Ligue 1 side after seven years and although he did not spell out his future, the world expects only one destination. Real have chased Mbappe for years without success but are finally poised to secure the 25-year-old at the end of his PSG deal. The French national team captain’s name was on everyone’s lips — those hawking Real merchandise on match days have been selling Mbappe scarves for weeks. Los Blancos became Spanish champions for the 36th time last week with four games to spare in La Liga and reached the Champions League final this week by overcoming Bayern Munich. Signing Mbappe, as the Spanish media report is now an inevitability, only seems a matter of time and could cap a glorious few weeks for Madrid president Florentino Perez. “Au revoir” ran the headline in Spanish sports daily AS, who report Mbappe’s signing will be announced in the next few weeks  “barring any major surprises”. Real are not expected to make any announcement until the end of the season, after the Champions League final against Dortmund at Wembley on June 1. Mbappe has never won the Champions League, which has been PSG’s main ambition during his time at the club. Real Madrid, meanwhile, have lifted the trophy five times in the last decade. On Friday, Mbappe said on X that his final home game for PSG will be on Sunday against Toulouse. “I never thought it would be this difficult to leave my country,” he said in the video post. “I think I needed this, a new challenge after seven years.” ‘CLUB LEGEND’ On the eve of his final home game for PSG, Mbappe was hailed as a “club legend” on Saturday by the coach Luis Enrique. “All I can say is marvellous things about Kylian Mbappe as a footballer and person,” Enrique told a press conference of the 25-year-old who has scored a club record 255 goals including 43 this season. “I understand his decision. He has been here for seven years and as a club legend. He has given everything to this club, and this club has given him everything as well. I wish him all the best for the future.” Spanish media report Mbappe’s grand unveiling at the Bernabeu is scheduled for the first week of June, after the Champions League final and before Les Bleus set off for Euro 2024, starting in Germany on June 14. MACRON’S OLYMPIC HOPE The Olympics in Paris open soon after the European Championships and French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday he hoped Mbappe would play in this year’s Games. “I have no particular comment to make other than the fact that I am counting upon Real Madrid to free up Kylian for the Olympic Games so he can play with the French team,” Macron said in a video posted on his X account. Real have already said that it will not lift its players’ obligations to the club in favour of their participation in the Olympics Games which are not part of the FIFA-designated international tournaments for which clubs must free up their players.

Canada arrests fourth Indian national in killing of Sikh activist,"A fourth Indian national was charged by Canadian authorities on Saturday in the 2023 killing of a separatist Sikh leader in Vancouver. Amandeep Singh, 22, was already being held for unrelated gun charges before being charged with “first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder” in the slaying of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Three other Indian nationals were arrested this month. The killing sparked a diplomatic row between Ottawa and New Delhi when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau linked Indian intelligence to the killing. Nijjar — who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 — had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India. He had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged “terrorism” and conspiracy to commit murder — allegations he denied. He was shot dead on June 18, 2023, by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver. Trudeau announced several months later that Canada had “credible allegations” connecting Indian intelligence to the slaying. India dismissed the allegations as “absurd” and responded furiously, briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats. In November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil. Prosecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning. The shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against China’s growing influence. US intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India’s top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, the Washington Post reported in April. Canada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two per cent of the country’s population, with a vocal minority calling for an independent state of Khalistan.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1833042/canada-arrests-fourth-indian-national-in-killing-of-sikh-activist
Israel orders Palestinians to evacuate from more areas of Rafah,"• Egypt refuses to coordinate with Israel on entry of aid from Rafah
• 37 Palestinians killed in overnight strikes across Gaza Strip CAIRO: Israel called on Saturday for Palestinians in more areas of Gaza’s southern city of Rafah to evacuate and head to what it calls an expanded humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, in a further indication that the military is pressing ahead with its plans for a ground attack on Rafah. In a post on social media site X, a military spokesperson also called on residents and displaced people in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, and 11 other neighbourhoods in the enclave to go immediately to places west of Gaza City. The Palestinian health ministry said at least 37 Palestinians, 24 of them from central Gaza areas, were killed in overnight airstrikes across the enclave, including in Rafah. “They threw fliers on Rafah and said, from Rafah to al-Zawayda is safe, people should evacuate there, and they did, and what has become of them? Dismembered bodies? There is no safe place in Gaza,” Khitam Al-Khatib, who said she had lost at least 10 of her relatives in an airstrike on a family house earlier on Saturday, told Reuters.  Al-Zawayda is a small town in central Gaza Strip that has been crowded by thousands of displaced people from across the enclave. The Israeli military said its aircraft struck tens of targets across the Strip over the past day, adding its ground troops had eliminated fighters in Zeitoun in recent hours. An Israeli airstrike killed at least seven people in a house in Beit Lahiya town in the northern Gaza Strip, all from the same family, medics said. In Rafah, residents said the new evacuation orders by the Israeli military covered areas in the centre of the city and left little doubt Israel planned to expand its ground offensive there. “The situation is very difficult, people are leaving their homes in panic,” said Khaled, 35, a resident of the Shaboura neighbourhood, an area where the new orders to leave have been issued. The Israeli military said it was continuing operational activity against Hamas fighters in eastern Rafah and on the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing. Despite heavy US pressure and alarm expressed by residents and humanitarian groups, Israel has said it will proceed with an incursion into Rafah, where more than one million displaced people have sought refuge during the seven-month-old war. Israeli tanks captured the main road dividing Rafah’s eastern and western sections on Friday, effectively encircling the eastern side in an assault that has caused Washington to hold up the delivery of some military aid to its ally. Two crossing points vital for delivery of aid to Gaza were still closed on Saturday. The Palestinian WAFA news agency said the Rafah crossing was closed for a fifth day, while another crossing, Kerem Shalom, has been shut for around a week. The latest evacuation orders came hours after internationally mediated ceasefire talks appeared to be faltering, with Hamas saying Israel’s rejection of the truce offer it had accepted returned things to square one. The Palestinian militant group also hinted it was reconsidering its negotiation policy. It did not elaborate on whether a review meant it would harden its terms for reaching a deal but said it would consult with other allied factions. In Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands were sheltering, Palestinians mourned relatives during funerals on Saturday. “Here they are, in pieces, here is my sister-in-law, without a head, my aunt is without a head, what is this injustice? Until when will this go on? We are exhausted, by God we are exhausted, I have lived in tents for the past seven months,” said Khatib, sitting near bodies wrapped in white shrouds bearing the names of the dead men and women. Egypt refuses to coordinate Egypt has refused to coordinate with Israel on the entry of aid into Gaza from the Rafah crossing due to Israel’s “unacceptable escalation”, Egypt’s state-affiliated Alqahera News satellite TV reported on Saturday, citing a senior official. The official also said that Egypt held Israel responsible for the deterioration of the situation in the Gaza Strip.

UAE hits out at Netanyahu for saying it may help run Gaza,"CAIRO: The United Arab Emirates hit out at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday after the Israeli leader said the Gulf state could be involved in aiding a future government in Gaza after the war. The prominent and influential Gulf state is one of few Arab states with official diplomatic ties to Israel, which it has maintained through Israel’s more than six-month war in Gaza, although relations appear to have become frayed. Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan rebuked Netanyahu in an early morning post on X, saying Abu Dhabi denounced the Israeli leader’s comments.  “The UAE stresses that the Israeli prime minister does not have any legal capacity to take this step, and the UAE refuses to be drawn into any plan aimed at providing cover for the Israeli presence in the Gaza Strip,” he said in an Arabic post. Sheikh Abdullah said the UAE would be prepared to support a Pale­stinian government that met the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people, which he said included independence. In an interview, Netanyahu said the UAE, Saudi Arabia and other countries could possibly assist a civilian government with Gazans in the enclave after the war. Sources said that Abu Dhabi’s relationship with Netanyahu has fractured over the military campaign, with Emirati officials now rarely speaking with him.

Washington says use of its weapons by Tel Aviv in Gaza violated law,"RAFAH: The United States has issued a stunning criticism of Israel’s use of American weapons in the Gaza attack, after Israeli forces intensified operations around the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced people are sheltering. Israel’s main international ally said in a report released on Friday that it was  “reasonable to assess” that Israel has used weapons in ways inconsistent with international humanitarian law during the seven-month crisis. But the long-awaited State Department report said it could not reach  “conclusive findings” and stopped short of blocking weapons shipments. Relations between the two allies slumped earlier in the week after US President Joe Biden said he would halt some arms deliveries if Israel went ahead with a full-scale assault on Rafah threatened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The US has warned that the reputational damage Israel will suffer if it storms a city where an estimated 1.4 million civilians are sheltering will far outweigh any possible military gain. UN chief Antonio Guterres said that Gaza risked an  “epic humanitarian disaster” if Israel launched a full-scale ground operation in Rafah.

Delhi CM Kejriwal exhorts Indians to resist ‘dictatorship’,"NEW DELHI: A top opponent of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged his compatriots to resist  “dictatorship” on Saturday, after the country’s top court provisionally released him from jail to campaign in national elections. Arvind Kejriwal, chief minister of the capital Delhi and a key leader in an opposition alliance formed to compete against Modi in the polls, was granted bail on Friday after weeks in custody. He is among several leaders of the bloc under criminal investigation, with his party describing his arrest as a  “political conspiracy” orchestrated by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to sideline its opponents ahead of the vote. In a defiant press conference the day after his release, Kejriwal said the outcome of the election would determine whether India remained a democracy. “I have come to beg 1.4 billion people to save my country,” he said.  “Save my country from this dictatorship.” Kejriwal also personally accused the prime minister of targeting his opponents with criminal probes. “Modi has started a very dangerous mission,” he said.  “Modi will send all opposition leaders to jail.” Kejriwal’s government was accused of corruption when it liberalised the sale of liquor in 2021 and gave up a lucrative government stake in the sector. The policy was withdrawn the following year, but the resulting probe into the alleged corrupt allocation of licences has since led to the jailing of two top Kejriwal allies. Rallies in support of Kejriwal, who refused to relinquish his post after his arrest, were held in numerous other big cities around India after he was taken into custody. More than 1,000 cheering supporters greeted him as he walked free from the capital’s Tihar Jail on Friday night. Kejriwal, 55, has been chief minister for nearly a decade and first came to office as a staunch anti-corruption crusader. He had resisted multiple summons from the Enforcement Directorate, India’s financial crimes agency, to be interrogated as part of the probe. ‘Fighting against corruption’ Kejriwal has consistently denied any wrongdoing since allegations of corruption were first levelled against him, including again on Saturday. “They sent me to jail and the PM says he is fighting against corruption,” he said. “If you want to fight corruption, learn from Arvind Kejriwal.” The Supreme Court said he could temporarily leave jail to campaign in India’s six-week election, on the condition that he returns to custody after the last day of voting on June 1. “No doubt, serious accusations have been made, but he has not been convicted,” the court’s ruling said.  “He is not a threat to the society.” His release was also made conditional on his agreement not to make public comment on the case against him, not to interact with witnesses in the case and not to visit the offices of the Delhi government. ‘Target political opponents’ Modi’s political opponents and international rights groups have long sounded the alarm on India’s shrinking democratic space. US think tank Freedom House said this year that the BJP had  “increasingly used government institutions to target political opponents”.

"Men must take the lead in standing up against sexual harassment, says Hamza Ali Abbasi","In an era of #MeToo and at a time when conversations about speaking up about harassment are prevalent, actor Hamza Ali Abbasi has made a very important point — that men have a vital role in stopping harassment by speaking up about it. In a recent interview to SAMAA TV, he emphasised the urgent need for men to take the lead in condemning and criminalising harassment in all its forms. He also took pride in belonging to a family that boasts accomplished women. “I’m very proud of them and grateful. It’s a fact that when women in your family are independent and powerful, they can support you and become your strength. But it is unfortunate that even today, women have to face harassment in all professional fields, whether it’s the corporate [world] or the showbiz.” The Pyarey Afzal and Alif actor added that the onus of fostering a safe and supportive environment for women lies on men because they’re the ones to blame for perpetuating a culture of silence and complicity. Calling for greater solidarity from men and emphasising the importance of creating inclusive environments where women can thrive professionally, Abbasi said, “We [men] should play a leading role in this situation. “We have to make sure that wherever we see harassment, we don’t accept it. We demonise it. We don’t encourage or normalise it. Because unfortunately, we, men, have normalised and celebrated such behaviour. We didn’t scrutinise it the way it should have been scrutinised. So we need to call out and criminalise such behaviour in our circles,” he added. Abbasi commended women who have spoken up against harassment and encouraged dialogue around the issue. “It gives me great optimism that in today’s day and age, women are very forthcoming and are calling out harassment, whether it’s online or at the workplace. The times when women would face harassment and stay mum about it are thankfully behind us.” The Legend of Maula Jatt star emphasised the need to encourage such behaviour among women. “The culture of speaking up also needs to be encouraged. Women should be able to make noise wherever they are if ever they face harassment of any kind. Without any fear or hesitation, women should be encouraged to raise hell. We need to eradicate the element of fear and shame among women.” By speaking out against harassment, Abbasi sends a powerful message to men everywhere — it is incumbent upon us to stand up, speak out, and actively work towards creating a world where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect.",https://images.dawn.com/news/1192429/men-must-take-the-lead-in-standing-up-against-sexual-harassment-says-hamza-ali-abbasi
"We asked moms what they really want for Mother’s Day — and no, it isn’t a kurta or a candle","Mother’s Day (arguably the most important ‘day’ for celebrating a loved one) is around the corner once again — and for those who have a mother figure present in their lives, the most pressing question is often what to get their mom for Mother’s Day. Before you grab your wallet and rush to your nearest mall to grab a basic candle and a basic kurta from K̶h̶a̶a̶d̶i̶ a local clothing store, know that we asked a bunch of moms what they really, truly want for Mother’s Day and we have the perfect answers for you. But, you won’t get them straight away. First, let us give you a little history lesson on why Mother’s Day is celebrated (just read it, your mom will be proud of you for knowing something). In the United States, Mother’s Day falls on the second Sunday of May, every year — and this year it is on May 12. Other countries have varying traditions and dates for marking the occasion, but since the US version currently looms over us, and most likely when your mom is expecting her present, we’ll stick to that one. The idea started in America when a woman, Anna Jarvis, held a small memorial service for her own mother on May 12, 1907, the BBC details. Shortly after that, most places in the US started celebrating the day, with the US president — he must’ve really loved his mother — making it a national holiday in 1914. Jarvis, however, was super unhappy with how companies began using the day as a money-making scheme and campaigned for the government to remove Mother’s Day from the calendar completely. Keeping in line with the theme of not getting what you wanted, Jarvis’s campaign against the holiday presumably did not work very well, because more than a century later we’re celebrating the holiday on a completely different continent — personally, I find it funny that we’re adhering to the US iteration of the holiday, even though the UK has their own version and they were the ones who colonised us and left us with a plethora of their traditions. We’re sorry we continue the tradition, Jarvis, we just love our moms! Given the global popularity of the day, mothers must definitely be an integral pillar of the family, right? Well, that and the fact that they risk their own lives to bring you into this world and then spend every subsequent moment putting your needs before their own. So the question remains — what do we get our moms for Mother’s Day? What could be possibly good enough for the women who care for us from the get-go and don’t stop until their very last breath? Here at Images, we thought the solution was simple — ask the moms what they want! Revolutionary. Here’s what moms want for Mother’s Day. I couldn’t start my research anywhere but my own mother, who has two kids — my younger brother (19) and me (24). Her answer was pretty straightforward, she wanted candles. This was not the reply I was hoping to hear, so I pushed her for another answer; after all, I had an article to write. Her second answer was that she wanted us to spend time with her, which pretty much ruined any plans I had of going out that night. Don’t worry, I will spend a lot of time with her!  While some moms want their children to spend more time with them, other mothers, especially those with younger kids, want some space — and rightfully so, I mean have you ever spent every single day with a five-year-old? They talk. A LOT. A mother of a four-year-old and an 11-month-old said she would love to check into a hotel with a stunning view, and spend a day being herself “without any roles like mother, wife, and sister”. “I’d get up whenever I want, eat anything I want, and just relax. I’d like my best friend to be there with me, and chat about everything but kids and husband and home,” she said. Mothers deserve the rest and relaxation — fresh white linens, room service, and absolutely no screams, snots or scrapes. Another mom, with children aged 11, 15 and 16, said she wanted a nice staycation away with the kids, but swiftly added that she would be okay without her children, too. And, again, we get it, we totally do, anyone would want some time away from the constant barrage of “mom, mom, mom, mom, mom?!”. A mom of a 12 and 16-year-old said she wanted breakfast in bed, a handmade card, a day without household chores and an official holiday from work — all of this seems achievable, except the last one. Capitalism will never give in that easily, unfortunately. However, maybe a sick leave would work? Even better, blame it on your kid and say they’re sick — hey, there have to be some perks to having children, and what are children even for if not to use for fake illness so you can enjoy Mother’s Day? “Somewhere I could just relax and not worry about the kids — like a girls’ trip but with [the] kids who would be looked after by the nannies,” a mother of a three-year-old and a 10-year-old said. You know, being a mother is starting to sound a lot like being a 24/7 nanny. We really hope this mother gets some help with her kids, even if just for the day.  When we asked a mother of a six and 11-year-old, her answer was short and sweet: “A day off from all responsibilities”. Given everything mothers do, for not just their kids but their entire family, wanting to do nothing is totally valid. So, perhaps the perfect gift for your mother would be you picking up the slack and doing some work around the house to offer her respite. A mom of an eight-month-old said she wanted a nanny who would supervise her baby, feed her and put her to bed, “basically all the tasks that [a] mother does”. She added that most importantly, she wanted a nanny to look after her baby so she could tend to other household chores — which has us shook; you would think the ONE time mothers are asked about themselves, they would prioritise themselves, instead of thinking about chores?! Leave it to moms and mom-figures to only think about working to make their family’s lives better. It is (going to be) Mother’s Day and we strongly believe moms should not do any household tasks on such a sacred day.  Another thing mothers really want? Your love — and that costs literally nothing. A mom of an eight-year-old said she wanted a handwritten note declaring how much her child loved her and why. Not only does that sound super sweet, it’s perfect for the age demographic. I’m sure moms can be the only people who cherish young children’s art; it’s called “unconditional love” for a reason. A mother of two teenage girls, on the other hand, said she “craves the feeling of being essential and cherished once more”. “While I cherish their independence, I long for reassurance from them.” She added that material gifts did hold some significance, and she preferred small, meaningful presents sprinkled throughout the day rather than one grand gesture. I’m going to take a moment here to say it sounds scary to be the mother of not one, but TWO teenagers. It’s like having the pretty, popular kids from school live with you. “You want to hang?” “No.” “You want to get some lunch?” “No.” “We could go out?” “No.” “Plus I want their father to know that he got the best mother for his kids he could possibly ask,” she added. My aunt, who has a 30-year-old daughter, maintained that material things were not for her at all. “I would want nothing more than the happiness of my child, and seeing them happy and relaxed is my goal. But the one thing I do want is for them to eat the food I have cooked and enjoy it. Nothing is more comforting and fulfilling for a mother than some time spent with her children”. Food is a reccurring theme, maybe because a lot of our mothers spend so much of their time and effort slaving away over the stove. A mother of three aged 18, 23 and 26 said she wanted all three of her kids to cook something for her separately, before quickly adding that she did not want that from her 18-year-old because she has exams. Once again, leave it to moms to worry about their children, even when they’re asked what they want. A quick pasta recipe won’t take more than 30 minutes, which is the perfect break from studying — don’t forget your mom did EVERYTHING with you inside her for nine months, and then clung to her hip for years. Time to repay her for you basically being a little parasite. However, the best answer came from a mother of a 15 and an 18-year-old: “As a mother, I want kids who are like dogs — they don’t answer back, wag their tails to greet you and are happy no matter what the treat is. Not this teenage attitude, shattitude.” LOL!  A mother of a four-year-old and a newborn baby said people should, at the very least, acknowledge everything mothers do and all the sacrifices they make, even if they do not support the mom because for mothers “everything is happening all at once”. She also joked that she would like some peace as well to enjoy a cup of tea or a meal, and as she was speaking her child could be heard in the background. “This! We want to be able to do one thing without interruptions.”  Being a mother cannot be easy, and one of the biggest stresses they face is the situation of the country they are raising their children in. A Dawn staffer, who is the mother of a two-year-old, told me that mothers, by virtue of motherhood, do not think of their own selves and always have their child on their mind. She said that she wanted the very best for her daughter and nothing for herself. “I constantly think of the future of the country she lives in and what I can do to give my child the very best chance at life in Pakistan. What I would want is to see my child grow and thrive, and for my efforts to be paid off.” Another young mom, with an 18-month-old daughter, said she wished a fairy godmother would come to Pakistan and make it a safer place for children, and that her child’s safety and security were the only things that worried her after she became a mother. Australian social worker Shaniera Akram, who is based in Karachi, had a special message for Mother’s Day: “To all the mothers out there, whether they are mothers who have given birth, adopted or become stepmothers, our job is all-consuming. There is no off button. We are on the job 24/7 and it is hard but what we get out of it is more rewarding than any you can ever ask for. We get to say at the end of the day, ‘we did that, we raised them and they are amazing’. That’s the biggest gift you can get as a mother.” So ditch the motia scented candle — I won’t be though, my mother is definitely getting the candle she wants — and the basic kurta. Chances are, your mom, no matter how old you are, wants some peace, some love and maybe some pampering. Now that we have equipped you with all this information, go forth and make this the perfect Mother’s Day. We would recommend some breakfast in bed (for your mom, not by her), some quality time with her and then some rest and relaxation for her while you look after everyday chores. Happy Mother’s Day to all mother-figures (and best of luck with your kids)!",https://images.dawn.com/news/1192428/we-asked-moms-what-they-really-want-for-mothers-day-and-no-it-isnt-a-kurta-or-a-candle
Fistula and child marriages: The two epidemics plaguing women in Gilgit-Baltistan,"Seema, a resident of Astore District of Gilgit-Baltistan, received the title, ‘Woman of the Year’, not for her achievements, but for a fate imposed upon her at a tender age: child marriage. One can’t help but wonder how entering into a marriage contract at a tender age warrants this title. Visibly upset, Seema recounted her story, explaining why she received the honour. Married at the tender age of 13 and diagnosed with vaginal fistula when she was 16 years old, Seema’s existence has since become synonymous with agony. Every villager, out of pity for her deteriorating health, would visit her, oblivious to the struggle she bore in silence. With no funds for treatment, her father-in-law had even asked the doctor to give her poison — a desperate plea for relief. Before delving further into Seema’s story, it is important to understand what vaginal fistula is. The condition occurs when an abnormal passage is created between the vagina and neighbouring pelvic organs like the bladder or rectum. This can lead to numerous complications, including urinary and faecal leakage, abnormal vaginal discharge, tissue damage, kidney infections, and various other symptoms. Doctors warn that untreated fistulas can escalate to reproductive system cancers, potentially even leading to death. Seema described the pain to be so agonising that she wished for a quick death on several occasions. It’s a stark contrast to the dreams that typically fill the heart of a 16-year-old girl — dreams of a future adorned with aspirations and possibilities. However, Seema found herself teetering on the precipice of despair, grappling with the grim reality of her life-long disease. It only makes sense for her to be called the ‘Woman of the Year,’ doesn’t it? Her journey isn’t merely reflective of the far-reaching consequences of fistula but is also a testament to the devastating consequences of child marriage. According to a Unicef report an estimated 18 per cent of young girls are wed before reaching adulthood [18 years of age], amounting to almost 19 million child brides in the country. The number of unreported instances is believed to be even higher. As per the National Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC), Pakistan has the sixth highest number of women married before the age of 18 in the world. The adverse impacts of early marriage are manifold, encompassing the deteriorating health of the young bride, high-risk pregnancy, and impediments to both her education and personal growth. Moreover, in developing countries such as Pakistan, the unregulated cycle of childbirth places a heavy financial strain on parents, as they struggle to support multiple children, ultimately perpetuating poverty within these families. Despite tireless global campaigns and legal enforcement in these countries, the insidious practice of child marriage persists. This prevalence is fuelled by a glaring lack of awareness regarding the severe repercussions of such unions, amplifying the issue. The plight of girls under 18 is particularly dire, as depicted in Seema’s case. Her story serves as a stark reminder of the health complications faced by these young brides face. From debilitating conditions like fistula to a myriad of other ailments, many women are condemned to a lifetime of anguish. While some manage to recover through treatment, others suffer without ever experiencing improvement in their health. Dr Sajjad Ahmed, who offers free treatment to patients at Koohi Goth Hospital in Karachi, said that a significant number of women travel long distances from remote areas to seek treatment at the hospital located in the port city’s Bin Qasim Town. This reality underscores the inadequacy of basic facilities accessible to women in Pakistan. At the other end of the country, Dr Sher Shah and his dedicated team annually organise medical camps in Gilgit, offering treatment and performing surgeries for fistula patients free of cost. While minor cases receive care at City Hospital Gilgit, those requiring more intensive procedures are referred to Koohi Goth Hospital in Karachi. Dr Sher Shah mentioned how the hospital serves patients not only from across the country but also extends care to individuals from Afghanistan, Iran, Sharjah, and Yemen. Drawing patients from the farthest corners of Sindh, Punjab, Chitral, and Gilgit-Baltistan, including the remote locales of Skardu, Diamir, and Ghizar, individuals recover under their expertise. The hospital has provided free surgeries to almost 40 patients from Gilgit-Baltistan alone. Despite the invaluable services rendered, the absence of more specialised hospitals for the condition remains a gap in the country’s healthcare infrastructure, he added. Dr Nazneen Zamir Farooqi, a gynaecologist at City Hospital Gilgit, gets patients from remote areas of Gilgit-Baltistan, including Diamer, Astor, Skardu, Kharmang, Darel, and Ghizar. In many of these regions, the scarcity of healthcare facilities and the absence of skilled attendants during childbirth worsen the problem. “The pervasive practice of child marriage significantly contributes to this crisis. When young girls are married off, their bodies are ill-equipped for childbirth — a biological reality — as physical maturity is typically achieved post-puberty,” she explained. Consequently, girls under 18 years face heightened risks of complications, and if they contract fistula, their suffering is only magnified. Throughout pregnancy and childbirth, the absence of adequate treatment can result in a spectrum of deformities in women’s bodies, often leading to the onset of debilitating diseases. Among these, fistula stands out as one of the most distressing, inflicting not only physical discomfort but also profound psychological and social ramifications. Girls married off at a young age have underdeveloped bodies and fragile bones. If they undergo childbirth before their bodies have fully matured, they are at risk of developing fistula. Similarly, older women who have borne numerous children may experience weakened muscles, rendering them incapable of delivering the baby during childbirth. In some cases, it may also lead them to develop this condition. In both scenarios, giving birth to a child becomes an excruciating process for the woman, wherein the pressure exerted by the baby’s head against the muscles between the bladder and the vagina may result in the formation of a fistula. In many cases, the babies are stillborn. Without immediate medical intervention, the affected woman is condemned to endure the pain. The Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929, a federal law in Pakistan in alignment with international conventions on children’s rights, unequivocally condemns a marriage involving a girl under 16 years of age and a boy under 18 years of age as a violation of fundamental rights. Although each province in Pakistan has established its own regulations, in the absence of specific provincial guidelines, national law takes precedence. Any breach of this law carries severe penalties, including imprisonment for up to six months and fines reaching up to Rs50,000, meant to serve as a deterrent against such grave infringements. As per the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) conducted in 2016-17, the prevalence of child marriages in Gilgit-Baltistan, especially in areas such as Chilas, Darel, Tangir, and Kharmang, stands alarmingly high, soaring to approximately 26pc. Despite concerted efforts to tackle the issue, including the introduction of legislation in 2015, progress has been hindered by opposition within the legislative assembly, leading to delays in its enactment. While the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 is in place, its enforcement in these regions falls well short of the mark. And without a legal mandate imposing age restrictions, many see no obligation to adhere to the law. Subsequently, the absence of robust legislation and effective enforcement mechanisms perpetuates the cycle of child marriages, leaving the issue entirely unresolved. Child marriage is not merely a tradition; it has a direct bearing on human health and development. While marriage may bring a sense of satisfaction for many, it also entails significant responsibilities, demanding mental, physical, and financial preparedness. Experts argue that minors lack the maturity essential for a thriving marriage, posing potential health risks. We cannot afford the luxury of complacency while the innocence of our children is sacrificed at the altar of an archaic practice. It falls upon each of us, as guardians of our collective conscience, to demand comprehensive legislation that will dismantle the structures perpetuating child marriages. For the sake of our daughters and sons, for the preservation of their health, dignity, and dreams, we must act decisively. The time for rhetoric has passed; it is now time for action.

From screens to streets: How Gen Z is disrupting the status quo and redefining activism,"Soft. Entitled. Snowflakes. Lazy. These are some of the characterisations about Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012) pushed in the media by older generations who have largely failed to connect with and understand what they are all about. But these disparaging words used to describe the generation are, in fact, baseless — these young individuals are anything but passive. To put it simply, this generation isn’t waiting for change; they’re demanding it. Over the past six months alone, they’ve orchestrated movements that have sent shockwaves through the status quo, leaving elites squirming in discomfort. It’s time to recognise their power, their passion, and their potential to reshape our world that has been long ruined by decades of complacency. Pro-Palestinian students take part in a protest in support of the Palestinians amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, at Columbia University in New York City, US, October 12, 2023 — Reuters We are seeing this play out at university campuses across America, where administrators resort to police intervention to suppress anti-war protests and encampments, only to witness a resounding backlash that reverberates far beyond their expectations. Tensions began to simmer on American university campuses soon after the terror attacks carried out by Hamas on October 7. As Israel continues to unleash an orgy of violence on Palestinians — the International Court of Justice has found it “plausible” that Israel is in violation of the Genocide Convention — the atmosphere on campuses has grown increasingly charged. Student groups have been suspended, walkouts have become increasingly common, and university towns have become the epicentre of the uncommitted campaign during the Democratic primary elections. A coalition of University of Michigan students rally at an encampment in the Diag to pressure the university to divest its endowment from companies that support Israel or could profit from the ongoing conflict on the University of Michigan college campus in Ann Arbor — Reuters Contrary to what the mainstream media would have you believe, the seething discontent isn’t confined to elite or progressive universities like Columbia and Berkeley. The numbers speak for themselves: one-third of adults under 30 say that their “sympathies lie either entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people (compared to 10 per cent or less for adults over 50), while 36pc of them believe that President Biden is “favouring Israelis too much” (compared to the 16pc or less for adults over 50). This has become a headache for Joe Biden, as he relies on the support of younger Americans to secure victory in the upcoming election in November. Demonstrators protest inside the Rockefeller Center asking for a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, as President Joe Biden attends an interview in midtown Manhattan, in New York, February 26 — Reuters The ongoing conflict is yet another testament to Generation Z’s profound empathy and commitment to equity, inclusion, and human rights. According to an Edelman survey spanning six countries, a staggering 70pc of Gen Z actively engages in social or political causes. What sets this generation apart is their digital fluency, enabling them to harness digital platforms, including decentralised media, to mobilise, educate, and advocate for change. Moreover, data shows that this generation watches the least amount of television, and prefers consuming content on platforms like TikTok (10.5 hours a week) and YouTube (6.9 hours a week). In fact, the fast-tracked nature of legislation seeking a TikTok ban in America is very much related to the fallout of the war in Gaza, and has unsurprisingly angered young Americans. Students build a protest encampment in support of Palestinians, at the University of Southern California’s Alumni Park, amid the ongoing conflict, in Los Angeles, California, US, April 24, 2024 — Reuters Engage in conversation with older generations, and you’ll often hear the refrain: “Younger generations are out of touch, indifferent, and perpetually glued to their screens.” Yet, this worry overlooks a crucial truth. As digital natives, today’s youth possess an unparalleled ability to navigate the labyrinth of misinformation, actively seek out diverse perspectives, and circumvent traditional gatekeepers, particularly within the media landscape. Their digital prowess not only connects them to the pulse of reality but empowers them to shape it with unprecedented clarity and purpose. Most importantly, Gen Z is demonstrating an unwavering commitment to a host of global challenges, spanning from climate change and gender diversity to the plight of Palestine. It speaks of their values and sense of responsibility — something their parents and mentors should not only acknowledge but also take immense pride in. Greek university and high school students take part in a demonstration against a planned bill which opens the way for the operation of private universities, in Athens, Greece, January 11, 2024 — Reuters Demonstrators and students hit a wall as they shout slogans during a protest against the Chilean public education system and the results of the referendum on a new constitution, in Santiago, Chile September 6, 2022 — Reuters From Malala Yousafzai to Greta Thunberg — the emerging cohort of leaders, particularly women — is mobilising millions worldwide. For adults, especially those clinging onto institutions and power, this rising generation represents a threat. This is not only because of the fact that these leaders and organisers are speaking truth to power, but because they are seeking to dismantle the status quo in a bid to build something better and more inclusive. Moreover, the discomfort among established elites stems from their utter cluelessness in navigating the digital landscape wielded by younger generations. This new breed of leaders is not only adept at harnessing digital tools but also possesses a deep understanding of how to use them effectively, leaving the status quo scrambling to keep pace. Demonstrators take part in an “Emergency Rally: Stand with Palestinians Under Siege in Gaza,” amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, October 14, 2023 — Reuters The unfolding events across American universities serve as a stark reminder: nothing rattles status quo elites more than the sight of peaceful protestors courageously raising their voices. This has been consistently true across centuries. Yet, amid the turbulence, organisation and activism displayed by these students is inspiring next generation of leaders around the world. It’s safe to say that the kids are doing just fine. It is the adults running the world that are the problem.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1829562/from-screens-to-streets-how-gen-z-is-disrupting-the-status-quo-and-redefining-activism
"Art group employs brainwaves, AI to  recreate landscapes","PARIS: The hypercolour image of a dark hill and lava flow is pretty enough — but its high-tech artificial intelligence origins make it special. It is the product of the brainwaves of one member of French art collective Obvious, collected in an MRI machine at the Brain Institute of the Pitie Salpetriere hospital in Paris. “I was thinking very hard about a volcano,” said Pierre Fautrel, one of the trio. He admits the resulting work was not exactly what he had in mind,  “but it has kept the basic elements: a flaming mountain with flowing lava and a landscape on a light background”. The trio of thirty-somethings, Fautrel, Hugo Caselles-Dupre and Gauthier Vernier, already gained international attention in 2018 by selling an AI-generated artwork at Christie’s in New York for more than 400,000 euros. For the latest project,  “Mind to Image”, they used an open-source programme, MindEye, which is able to retrieve and reconstruct viewed images from brain activity, combining it with their own AI programme to create artworks. They tried two different versions — one in which they looked at pictures and tried to replicate them simply through their brainwaves captured in the MRI. They also tried recreating their invented images based on written descriptions. For each, they repeated the process many times over 10 hours to create a database for their AI. “We’ve known for around 10 years that it’s possible to reconstruct a viewed image from the activity of the visual cortex,” said Alizee Lopez-Persem, a researcher at the Brain Institute.

Pakistan’s iCube-Qamar beams back first images from moon’s orbit,"Pakis­tan’s inaugural lunar satellite iCube-Qamar on Friday transmitted the first-ever images captured by it from the lunar orbit, the national space agency said. The satellite, part of China’s Chang’e-6 lunar mission, was launched from the Hainan province on May 3 and had successfully entered the moon’s orbit at 1:14pm on May 8. The moon is at an average distance of 384,400km from earth. The lunar module was designed by Islamabad’s Institute of Space Technology (IST) in collaboration with China’s Shanghai University (SJTU) and Pakistan’s national space agency Suparco. The landmark images were unveiled at a ceremony organised at the China National Space Agency (CNSA) to mark the successful mission accomplishment, IST spokesperson and head of Department of Electrical and Computer Science, Dr Khurram Khursheed told Dawn.com. They were officially handed over to Pakistan’s ambassador to Beijing, she added. View this post on Instagram  One of the first-ever images captured by Pakis­tan’s inaugural lunar satellite iCube-Qamar shows the moon and the sun. —  Suparco/CNSA The iCube-Q orbiter carries two optical cameras to image the lunar surface. The module is a cube satellite or cubesat — miniature satellites typically characterised by their small size and standardized cubic design. Due to their compact size and relatively low cost compared to traditional satellites, CubeSats offered opportunities for universities, research institutions and commercial entities to participate in space missions and gather valuable data for scientific advancement and innovation. Operating in extreme temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius, the satellite features a 7-kilogramme one-megapixel camera tailored for missions with power constraints.  Dr Khursheed had said the satellite would play a critical role in deep space missions. “Its surface-level analysis capabilities, transmitting images at a modest 1-kbps, will provide crucial data on crater locations, water, and traces of ice on the moon’s surface,” he had said. As the Chinese lander collects rock and soil samples, iCube-Q will spend three to six months orbiting the moon, capturing and transmitting images of the moon back to Earth. The IST said the opportunity to release the cubesat in lunar orbit from the Chang’e-6 mission was offered by the CNSA through the Asia Pacific Space Cooperation Organisation (Apsco). After a thorough evaluation, Pakistan’s proposal was accepted out of all Apsco member states. One of the first-ever images captured by Pakis­tan’s inaugural lunar satellite iCube-Qamar shows the sun shining brightly. —  Suparco/CNSA The Chang’e-6 mission, which aims to explore the moon’s “dark side”, employs lunar research payloads from multiple countries, including Pakistan’s iCube-Qamar satellite. The mission is named after the mythical Chinese moon goddess. Nasa is banned by US law from any collaboration, direct or indirect, with China. On Chang’e-6, China is carrying payloads from France, Italy, Sweden and Pakistan, while Chang’e-7 will bear payloads from Russia, Switzerland and Thailand when it launches in 2026.  Chang’e-6 aims to collect around 2kg of lunar samples from the far side of the Moon and bring them back to Earth for analysis. Chinese state news agency Xinhua had hailed it as “the first endeavour of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration”. China will send a robotic spacecraft in the coming days on a round trip to the moon’s far side in the first of three technically demanding missions that will pave the way for an inaugural Chinese crewed landing and a base on the lunar south pole. The probe is set to land in the immense South Pole-Aitken Basin, one of the largest known impact craters in the solar system. Once there, it will scoop up lunar soil and rocks, and carry out other experiments in the landing zone. With no direct line of sight with the Earth, Chang’e-6 must rely on a recently deployed relay satellite orbiting the moon during its 53-day mission, including a never-before-attempted ascent from the moon’s “hidden” side on its return journey home.",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832658/pakistans-icube-qamar-beams-back-first-images-from-moons-orbit
FIFA’S FOUL ON PAKISTAN FOOTBALL,"Apathy, manipulation and intrigue seem to define Pakistan football. While players and fans of football continue to rue the state of the sport in the country despite its undoubted popularity, the machinations in its governing body, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF), paint a picture of those at the helm working for their own personal interests rather than for the good of its main stakeholders. But now there seems to be an unholy nexus between such interests and parts of the global football governing body Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) as well. FIFA has suspended the country twice in the last decade alone — including over interference in the PFF elections. Eventually, the world governing body resorted to a stopgap solution of appointing a “Normalisation Committee” (NC) in 2019. It was given the explicit task to hold the PFF elections transparently, while managing football activities, including conducting regular domestic football tournaments, till the appointment of a new governing board.  But even this stopgap solution has now been mired in controversy, with the NC failing woefully short of meeting its mandate and getting multiple extensions to its tenure along the way. One major criticism against this stopgap NC is that the man steering it — Pakistani-Canadian tech entrepreneur Haroon Malik — is trying to set up a franchise league, on similar lines as cricket’s glitzy Pakistan Super League, at the expense of a club-based domestic league necessary for the grassroots development of the sport. This Eos investigation will reveal how Malik is actively trying to engineer a situation that would enable him to continue exerting his influence over the PFF — even after his departure following elections for a new governing body — and how some of the highest-ranking officials in FIFA are part of an elaborate scheme to upend Pakistan football for their own gains. Everyone agrees that Pakistan football needs a regular league system to provide a platform for local footballers and to capitalise on the growing fan interest in the sport. But is a franchise system like cricket’s PSL the best way forward? And why is an interim football administration pushing for it? FAR FROM NORMALISED On a breezy Ramazan night during the second week of March, two football teams took to a ground nestled in the hills to Karachi’s north. There was an extravagant ceremony before the match, with fireworks aplenty.  It was the opening match of the Ramazan Gold Cup. Sights like these have become few and far between in Pakistan football and the PFF had nothing to do with it. This tournament had been organised privately, with domestic football activity having become non-existent in the country. The Pakistan Premier Football League (PPFL), the country’s top-tier competition, hasn’t been held by the PFF since 2018. It’s something that has irked Pakistan’s history-making head coach Stephen Constantine. Constantine — who has been demanding that the league be restarted — wasn’t in attendance at the Naya Nazimabad Football Stadium, however. The 61-year-old Englishman was in Lahore, overseeing the national team’s preparations for its upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan. A day earlier in Lahore, Constantine was visibly irate during an interaction with reporters. Peppered with questions regarding Pakistan’s chances against Jordan — who had recently ended as runners-up in the Asian Cup — the English coach was blunt and unforgiving. Time and again, Constantine has reiterated that it is fundamentally important that Pakistan revives its league structure, which can allow local players to have regular competition. Since taking up the job in October 2023, Constantine has been adamant that a functioning league would allow him to have a greater pool of local players to choose from, instead of working only with those at his disposal at the training camp. He was merely repeating himself six months on. He was also critical of the stopgap NC over the delay in organising the National Challenge Cup, an annual month-long football tournament, which was suspended after the group stages in January last year. For him, the tournament could have been a starting point for the league. “I just heard there were 5,000 clubs in Pakistan,” he said, referring to the results of the recent club scrutiny — disputed at several levels — carried out by the stopgap NC. “You don’t need every district to be part of the league. We had a Challenge Cup with 32 teams. Just take 16 teams from it and start the bloody league.” What Constantine doesn’t know is that the PFF’s internal problems aren’t the only impediment to the revival and resumption of the domestic league. More than a year before his appointment as the chairman of the FIFA appointed ‘Normalisation Committee’ in December 2021, Haroon Malik visited the FIFA headquarters in Zurich for a ‘secret meeting’ that would determine the future trajectory of Pakistan football. GAMING THE SYSTEM To be fair, Pakistan football suffers from a multitude of problems: from a decades-long power struggle over control of the federation, including a hostile takeover of its premises in 2021 — which resulted in a 15-month suspension of Pakistan by FIFA — to the lack of clarity over whether any future domestic league would be a club or departmental event, or if it would take place at all. This is aside from national team players often going unpaid for months, and the country’s and clubs’ abysmal performance in international competitions.  The PFF has also failed on the administrative front, with elections for the new governing body not held in the three years since Malik was appointed to lead the stopgap NC. One of the elections conducted by the stopgap NC, for the referee’s association, remains disputed. In another controversial decision, the PFF allowed newly registered clubs the right to vote — against the PFF Constitution — in the ongoing district elections. These clubs were scrutinised as part of PFF’s extensive programme to register clubs, the long-delayed first step towards holding elections. A novel way of voting has also been introduced for the district elections, with votes to be cast through WhatsApp, which has raised further alarm among the footballing community. There’s a method to the madness, however. Under the PFF constitution, registered clubs vote for district associations, which in turn vote for the provincial associations. Three nominees each from the four provinces and one from Islamabad become part of the PFF Executive Committee (ExCo). The ExCo, comprising a total of 26 members, votes for the president. Other relevant associations and groups, like that of the referees, also have one vote as do the eight departmental teams and the club that wins the women’s national championship. With a simple majority required to win, support from the provinces and Islamabad alone can tip the election in a candidate’s favour. With clubs — that had voting rights previously, when the last PFF election was held in 2015 — set to vote for the stakeholders who have been vying for power for the past several years, detractors have accused the NC of manipulating the still-to-be-held elections by including newly registered clubs. The extent of the control the Haroon Malik-led governing body holds over the election has resulted in concerns over transparency. In the meantime, the government has written to FIFA on multiple occasions, most recently in December, calling for a change in the NC over its failure to hold elections within the prescribed time. Despite the vociferous complaints, FIFA gave Haroon Malik and his team another nine-month extension, in March this year. To understand why Malik continues to enjoy FIFA’s unwavering support and patronage, we have to rewind back to a year before Malik’s appointment as the NC chairman in January 2021. In retrospect, this provided the first glimpse of what was at play and how FIFA was committing the biggest foul on Pakistan football. Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league, only came to light after he was forced out
of the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. Pakistan head coach Stephen Constantine with his players during a training session at the Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium in Islamabad in November 2023: the Englishman has repeatedly expressed his frustration over the lack of regular domestic football in the country | White Star THE MOVERS AND SHAKERS OF PAKISTAN FOOTBALL On a cold December afternoon in 2019, Haroon Malik posed for a picture outside the FIFA headquarters in Zurich. “Discussing Pakistan football! Invigorating meetings, exciting times!” he captioned the picture on X, then known as Twitter. The discussions that took place in the Swiss city on that day would shape the future of Pakistan football. Plans for it had been set in motion months before. In August 2019, a month before FIFA first announced the NC for the PFF, global professional services firm KPMG had begun reaching out to people with knowledge of Pakistan football. During its initial correspondence, the KPMG Football Benchmark department said that it had started “an exciting project on football in Pakistan for a prominent client.” When discussions began, it emerged that it wanted to discuss the holding of a franchise league in Pakistan. Around that same time, a Facebook page was launched by the name of Football Club Pakistan (FCPK). Those working for the page aimed at providing football updates and were employed by media communications company Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan — the Pakistan branch of Starcom, which is headquartered in Chicago and which, in turn, is a subsidiary of global marketing and communication giants Publicis Groupe. FCPK was Malik’s first foray into Pakistan football. Some 15 months after FCPK was launched, the Canadian-Pakistani tech entrepreneur was named the chairman of the PFF Normalisation Committee, following the resignation of his predecessor Humza Khan. But it is what Malik was doing in those intervening months that made his appointment one that raises issues of conflict of interest. A FOOTBALLING CHESSBOARD Back in 2019, leading the discussions on that “exciting project on football in Pakistan” was KPMG’s former sports advisory manager, Yacine Sosse Alaoui. Alaoui has since left KPMG, joining FIFA as its business intelligence manager in September 2020. But a little over six months earlier, in February 2020, Alaoui and Andrea Sartori, the head of KPMG Football Benchmark, had accompanied Malik for a trip to Kuala Lumpur, where they met with officials from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) about what Malik called “discussing opportunities and ideas for Pakistan football.” Malik had not been named as head of the NC at that time. “Haroon Malik came to the AFC in 2020 with people from KPMG,” a source in Asian football’s governing body told Eos. “Discussions with the marketing department centred on a competition.” When the AFC was asked about that visit, a spokesperson of Asia’s football governing body termed it “a courtesy visit.” In fact, it was the December 2019 meeting in Zurich that had reportedly set up discussions with the AFC. The FIFA headquarters is a seven-storey building: two floors above ground and five underground. It was a closed-doors secret meeting on one of those levels that would script the future of Pakistan football. In alleged attendance alongside Sartori, Alaoui and Malik were Mario Gallavotti, the Italian lawyer who heads FIFA’s independent committees; Romy Gai, the chairman of London-based sports industry operators AWE International Group; and Pakistani advertising mogul Raihan Merchant. The proposal was laid out for holding a franchise league in Pakistan with Gallavotti and Gai — who would in 2022 become FIFA’s chief business officer — on board. Their interests remain unknown, but the talk in FIFA at that time was “that something big was going to happen in Pakistan football.” Sartori, Gai and Gallavotti are all Italian. When FIFA was approached for comment in 2022 regarding that meeting, its spokesperson gave a stern reply: “Please be informed that there are no updates regarding the matter you’ve mentioned.” The world football body did not comment on whether Gallavotti and Gai were part of that meeting, although they did not deny it either. Meanwhile Merchant, when contacted by Eos, denied his presence at the meeting. A source close to the discussion, however, says otherwise: “They [Gallavotti and Gai] were really pushing for the league to happen,” the source told Eos. “The purpose of the meeting seemed to push for its endorsement.” It was clear that Malik and his associates didn’t want to come out as rebels. They wanted to hold the league with the PFF’s blessings, as part of the domestic calendar, but also as sole holders of all rights for the event. Football was going to be the third sports discipline Z2C Limited — the holding company for ventures owned by Merchant, which also has Starcom MediaVest Group Pakistan, now Brainchild Communications — was going to organise a league for. Malik has been an executive director at Z2C since January 2019 — a position he still holds. Merchant and Malik also are alumni of the same university. Malik’s FCPK would become the ideal social media tool to propagate the league. Meanwhile, Z2C also had BSports — a sports app that combined social and data feeds with a livestream of sports events. It also had digital rights for the Pakistan Super League. The question being raised is whether Malik’s interest is in putting the affairs of the PFF in order as head of the NC or to push forward the franchise league he is invested in. Haroon Malik’s Instagram post showing him at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich on December 5, 2019, more than a year before his appointment by FIFA as the NC chairman | Instagram/roon.toon FIFA’S ROLE While giving another nine-month extension to Haroon Malik and his team till March 2024 — originally the NC had been appointed in September 2019 till June 2020, while Haroon was appointed the NC chairman in January 2021, for a nine-month period — FIFA had warned of possible sanctions being imposed if PFF elections weren’t held by then. But despite little headway being made and multiple deadlines being missed, FIFA has once again extended its mandate till December 2024. “Of course, it’s those links high up in FIFA,” one source close to the matter tells Eos. “With Haroon there, the franchise league plan stays alive.” In the meantime, most former Starcom employees are now working for the PFF, a simple LinkedIn search will show. Hasnain Haider, PFF’s head of digital media, was a project manager at Starcom. PFF’s football performance analyst, Irtaza Hussain, was community manager for FCPK at Starcom. PFF’s current creative manager, Haider Ali, was formerly at Z2C. While the NC has been unable to pay dues to players of the national teams because of an audit objection raised by FIFA, the employees continue to get paid by funds coming in from the global football body. “The PFF is effectively being run by Starcom,” a source in the NC tells Eos. “The groundwork is being laid for the franchise league they want to hold.” Malik, though, hasn’t been the only one looking to organise a football league in Pakistan. UK-based TouchSky Group, Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Peshawar Zalmi owner Javed Afridi and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa football official Shahid Shinwari have all publicly stated their intentions of doing so as well. TouchSky, later rebranded as Global Soccer Ventures and now repackaged as Pakistan Football League, is set to unveil its franchise league next month. It has set a date of November 1 to hold its franchise league which, contrary to the brochures it has been sending out, does not have the endorsement of the English Premier League or its clubs. But with the PFF having the final say over any league, Haroon’s position as the NC chief, which will see him hold elections for a new executive committee of the country’s football governing body, means there is a conflict of interest, even if he says that FIFA doesn’t think there is any. “Anyone associated with football, anywhere in the world, would have some stake in the game,” Haroon told Eos in April 2021. “It is normal, and natural. You cannot have someone who knows nothing about football, nothing about the market that they are operating in, and be responsible for football. Employers determine if conflict of interests are potentially troublesome. FIFA determined that my commercial interests have no conflict with this role [as NC chief]. If FIFA is okay, then that is the final word.” In fact, FIFA did not specifically comment on Haroon’s commercial interests having a conflict with his role, but its spokesperson said that “in line with standard procedures, all members of the Normalisation Committee were subject to stringent eligibility checks.” The spokesperson did not disclose whether FIFA had knowledge of Haroon’s elaborate plans of holding a league, or whether they were investigated during the eligibility checks, but added: “FIFA has no further comment at this stage.”  TAKING INSPIRATION FROM THE PSL In 2015, Z2C helped launch the PSL. Its affiliate, Blitz Advertising, was a broadcasting, live-streaming and a marketing partner for the league. But the partnership fell apart due to a legal dispute in 2020, with the Pakistan Cricket Board claiming victory in its arbitration proceedings against Blitz over rights fee payments related to the PSL two years later. Blitz has long harboured hopes of holding a football league on similar lines. With football being an untapped market in Pakistan, with massive potential returns for the initiators, they aren’t the only ones. For some time, Badar “Bobby” Refaie, the former director marketing of the PCB, seemed to be driving forward Z2C’s football ambitions externally, even though he brushed it off as small talk in a conversation during a PSL match in 2021. “They just can’t get it together,” he said. Badar has been involved in almost every sport — from organising a tour of hockey legends to Pakistan to the National Volleyball Championships.  “Working on new ideas, beside PSL for your Sports projects [sic],” he wrote to Merchant on a Facebook post in March 2019, adding three pictures: a group photo of former hockey stars with the chief of army staff, one of himself alongside squash great Jahangir Khan and another of Spanish football legend Carles Puyol waving to crowds at the National Stadium in Karachi, during the final of the 2019 PSL. Puyol’s visit to Karachi was part of a series of launch events for the World Soccer Stars which, in November 2019, saw him, Brazilian Kaka, Portuguese Luis Figo and Frenchman Nicolas Anelka play two exhibition matches in Pakistan. Ahead of the PSL final in March that year, TouchSky — who were also behind the World Soccer Stars event — had inked a deal with the PFF, which was elected in 2018 following elections conducted on the orders of the Supreme Court and not recognised by FIFA, to organise two leagues: a franchise league and a rebranded version of the Pakistan Premier Football League. The deal, and their plans, came crashing down when FIFA appointed the NC to oversee football affairs in Pakistan. TouchSky tried to do a similar deal with the PFF NC of Haroon’s predecessor Humza Khan, but were rebuffed.  ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES? Haroon Malik’s and Z2C’s plans had already taken off the ground by then. Visits to both AFC and FIFA had been completed. And once Humza Khan resigned, Malik’s path to take up the reins of the NC was cleared — thanks to support from Gallavotti, one of FIFA president Gianni Infantino’s key advisers. But Malik’s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league — only came to light after he was forced out of the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, Ashfaq Hussain Shah, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front. That forcible takeover of PFF headquarters by Shah eventually saw FIFA ban Pakistan for 15 months. Malik aired his views on franchise leagues after FIFA and UEFA crushed plans for a breakaway European Super League (ESL), which was in many ways akin to the franchise system common in American sports. “Looking at our club structures and history, there are multiple options here,” Malik expressed on X, while delving into a discussion on the collapsed ESL. “A hybrid model transitioning into promotion/relegation makes sense to me. [America’s] Major League Soccer, [Japan’s] J-League is a good conversation starter.” Malik expanded on this: “So many possibilities. Bottom line — either one is good for the players! Get them playing! Enablers: Fandom, Partnerships and Broadcast. Not insurmountable!” When asked why a traditional league model — which would see the country’s football club culture thrive — might not be better than a franchise league model for Pakistan, Haroon replied, “We are a ways away from club licensing, and regulations get stringent everywhere.” However, franchise leagues run for a short period of time, with little time to invest in grassroots football or academies. Club football, on the other hand, runs through the calendar year, giving players the opportunity to get regular competitive football. Moreover, club-based leagues have the system of relegation and promotion, which operate on sporting merit, while franchise leagues are closed competitions. The Major League Soccer (MLS) — a franchise league system — has achieved huge popularity in the United States. The MLS, however, runs like a regular league, filling up a calendar year. In India, the Indian Super League had to eventually be expanded for it to become the country’s national league. Its current season, which began in September, will culminate in May. Another concern is that franchise teams will take up a sizeable chunk of whatever sponsorship is on offer, leaving nothing for the clubs to fund their programmes. This is already a problem for Pakistani club sides. With the PPFL largely made up of departments, and with none of the teams fulfilling AFC’s club licensing regulations, Pakistan has been unable to send a representative to continental competitions. Malik, however, believes that wouldn’t be a concern for potential team owners in the model suggested by him. “Setting up the commercial model is key, adapted to our local market and the sporting culture here,” he said during that exchange. “Once that is done, everything is like Tetris, blocks falling into place.” Malik’s conviction at that point seemingly stemmed from the fact that his plans were already underway, with FCPK set to take care of fandom and Z2C, with its huge portfolio of clients, making sure of partnerships and broadcast. But the FIFA suspension broke that acceleration. When Malik and members of his NC eventually returned after being handed back the PFF premises that had been taken over and the FIFA ban getting lifted in June 2022, they were given a further year to complete the mandate. The NC was then given another extension until March 2024 and now has until December to complete the process. Meanwhile, detractors insist that the extensions are part of a larger plan to consolidate Malik’s control of the election process and the federation. TIME TO TURN A CORNER Such control over the election is key to bringing the league plan of Malik’s Z2C, Gallavotti and Gai to fruition. If a candidate they’re backing comes into power, it would be easier to get the league rubber-stamped. It would also ensure that the new PFF will effectively be run by former employees of Z2C. “Gallavotti and Gai are part of FIFA’s inner circle, closest to Infantino,” one source in the global football body tells Eos. “If they want the league to happen, it will happen sooner or later.” FIFA’s aim of appointing the NC was to have transparent elections of the PFF but that now seems to be turning into, in footballing terms, a red card offence. The global football body can point to the fact that it was during the NC’s tenure that Pakistan got past the first round of World Cup qualifying for the first time in history. But, even if the league eventually begins, the damage caused to the country’s domestic football scene during the last few years is unforgivable. Earlier this year, the NC made a point of degrading three top-tier clubs of the country. When the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) asked for nominees from Pakistan for the inaugural SAFF Club Championship, the NC shortlisted three clubs from Balochistan — Afghan FC, Muslim FC and Baloch FC — for the event. A tournament between the trio was announced to select Pakistan’s representative, but it never took place, as the clubs baulked at the financial guarantees the NC sought from them beforehand. The NC later stated that the clubs weren’t interested in participating at the SAFF event. It goes back to what Malik said in that exchange on X about clubs not coming close to meeting licensing regulations. Constantine, if he stays that long, will in all probability get a league for his players, but it may not be a club-based one. As far as the clubs in the country are concerned, their fate seems to have been sealed by those in FIFA’s inner circle. The writer is Dawn’s Sports Editor.

ESSAY: WE’RE READY FOR YOUR CLOSE-UP NOW,"JUNE 13, 2014 I am excited to be here, thrilled to have the opportunity to audition. Despite being on the verge of throwing up, I walk into the audition room assertively. The male and female casting directors size me up. They study the way I carry myself. They ascertain my charisma, assess my brand potential and evaluate my attractiveness. I am conscious of all of it and yet, I allow them to continue doing it. I am a willing participant in this game, voluntarily choosing to subject myself to constant rejections. Perhaps all artists have masochistic tendencies and perhaps these are mine. The casting directors thank me for coming in and I thank them for their time. I notice that I am trembling as I grab my bag from the floor. Before I have even stepped out of the room, the whisperings have begun. As I stumble out into the waiting room, the other actresses peer closely at me, attempting to decipher whether I blew it or bagged the role. I remain stoic and they hastily return to rehearsing their monologues. We are all clones of one another. We hold out hope, waiting for that singular break, which will catapult our lives into a growing trajectory. Diary entries from a former actor reflect on how the desire to conform to the norms of the entertainment industry allowed her to lose her own sense of self and how words helped her rediscover it The room reeks of desperation and throbs with want. I walk out. Upon returning home, I tactfully avoid my mother, who will undoubtedly want to know how the audition went. I loiter aimlessly in the kitchen, before finally grabbing a glass of water and heading to my bedroom. I feel restless and out of control. I need to reaffirm my beauty. I pick up my phone and select a desirable photo of myself from my camera roll. In it, I’m half-smiling, caught in the ‘golden hour.’ I post it to my Instagram and, within a couple of hours, 192 people like it. The comments roll in slowly: ‘stunning!!’, ‘OMG, so beautiful.’ I’m moderately satisfied. I move over to my Instagram mailbox and scroll through a handful of DMs from random men. This, in a way, also reaffirms my beauty. I’m living in the male gaze and I no longer mind it. I’ve done good. JULY 15, 2015 Across my teenage years, I work sporadically as an actress in Karachi. I scour Facebook pages of production houses and advertising agencies and bookmark audition callouts. I, then, eagerly drive to audition at rented bungalows in Defence and Sea View. I carefully curate bits of work in commercials, short films and plays — the only mediums where I am provided a larger margin to experiment as a female performer in Pakistan. I am cast as the ‘feminist, middle-aged woman whose husband is cheating on her’ in a contemporary play or as the ‘galvanising, empowered 20-something Pakistani woman’ in a commercial. I stare into cameras, grim and unsmiling. I find comfortable homes on stage and sets. I revel in the camaraderie of grown-up adults playing make-believe. I don’t mind the long hours or the protracted time it takes for the shots to be lit up — this is all worth the wait. The stage, for me, has become a safe space to be vulnerable, without judgement. In a way, it is a refuge from the hardening of the soul that comes with growing up as a woman in this world. Though I am pleased with my work, a part of me remains discontent. There is a scarcity of roles in Pakistan. Playing the traumatised daughter-in-law or the scorned woman are unappealing options. In auditions, I am still patronised by casting directors, who tell me to ‘be less angry.’ Yet, I play along. I be what they need. I wear make-up, albeit horrendously. I try to appear striking. And then, I am mortified when I am not given a callback. My parents are nonplussed. They cannot fathom why their academically gifted daughter prefers a profession where she is commodified and where her youth is a currency. They cannot understand why I have promised loyalty to a media machine that still operates on patriarchal benchmarks of beauty. Unsurprisingly, by my early adulthood, I fail to carve out my own identity. I forfeit my voice. I become an extension of something else and nothing more. FEBRUARY 25, 2017 There are specific moments on set when I am hyper-aware of my gender. I spend hours suspended from reality, with a cast and crew who are strangers I am introduced to just a few hours earlier. We all attempt to foster greater intimacy for a worthier creative breakthrough — this is within the acting job description, after all. But there are times when this faux closeness is exploited by those with far greater clout than me and, in those moments, the onus of protecting myself falls on me alone. So, I grudgingly laugh along to misogynistic jokes. I do my best not to appear over-friendly. I refuse to prolong conversations beyond work on WhatsApp with casting agents. And after shows, I head straight home, avoiding the spaces where things get murky. Because, who will believe me? Historically in Pakistan, women simply become a centre of speculation upon whom moral investigations are conducted. Society and viewers will ultimately turn the blame on me – I chose to be a pawn in this industry. I, a Pakistani-Muslim woman, have entered this ‘vulgarity’ out of my own volition. I do what other women do. I silence myself. I relive traumas. There is no Human Resource team, there are no harassment policies read out on the first day of production, and there is no power I hold. Everything simply goes. AUGUST 12, 2018 It’s August and I’m cast in a commercial, which releases on Pakistan’s Independence Day. Ironically, the theme of this commercial is ‘women empowerment.’ Ironic because, as I sit in my makeup chair, artists arrive to accentuate my features, cover up my blemishes and contour my nose. Intermittently, they drop in beauty tips on how to ‘tame my hair’ and encourage me to acquire better make-up. I nod politely, as if I’ll actually consider their advice, but all I feel internally is dejected. For years, I had assumed that my mind, my imagination and my education were worthy devices. But in actuality, I had greatly underestimated how much of the world ran on beauty. I slump forward in my chair and think about how I have given so much of myself to a profession where I am a throwaway, simply replaceable by the next pretty young thing who walks through those doors. SEPTEMBER 20, 2018 I’ve decided to take a break from acting. It’s been five years of endless auditions and unremitting rejections. Of course, discounting the notion that my self-esteem has plummeted to irredeemable depths, the decision also makes sense — I’m leaving Pakistan for the first time, to complete my undergraduate degree abroad. In England, I periodically dabble in theatre to satisfy my acting itch. I perform in consequential plays like The Vagina Monologues. I deliver dramatic readings of passages from exiled authors in dimly lit studios. But even here, as a brown-Muslim woman, the roles I am given are scant. The leads are reserved for white people, whilst other ethnicities are relegated to the supporting roles. Here, I face other hitches — I am seen as either too dark or not dark enough. I am either a religious creature or an outlandish woman from an exotic land. I am still seen from a white person’s perspective. MARCH 27, 2020 The world has stopped turning on its wheels. A global pandemic rages across the globe and humanity has been ordered to stay home. I scramble to return to Pakistan and spend the next few weeks doing what everyone else is doing — baking, scrolling through social media and bingeing on television shows. But, after a while, the days mesh into one and I am forced to sit with myself for the first time in my life. I reflect and ponder over the last couple of years, which led to me becoming the woman I am today. One restless night, I pick up my laptop in search of an avenue for creative expression. I open up a blank MS Word document and begin to write. And after 22 years of silencing my voice, the words gush out of me, like a broken faucet which won’t turn off. These words had seemingly lived within me, waiting with bated breath, soundlessly patient. So, I write. I write about the experiences I never had. I write stories in which I garbage social norms and where women are flawed individuals. I write stories about the spaces I wish to inhabit. I write about the women who inhabit my real life — women who fire after their yearnings without the fear of retribution. Slowly, I begin sending out my tales into the world, hoping my lived experiences may relate to someone. I face the familiar call of rejection but, ultimately, the year of the pandemic becomes the year of writing. Through those long months of staying at home, I use my words to reckon with the trauma of my past and the horrifying moments I allowed myself to go through. With reclaiming my narrative, I feel cathartic. By writing about the pain, I have not let it best me. I am finally the protagonist of my own story. As I write, I relearn everything I have been taught. I purge all the venomous psychology, instilled in me as a young girl. I begin to closely understand my womanhood. In my essays and stories, my beauty and physicality are no longer determining factors in my worthiness. My mind is my weapon and, unlike my beauty, it doesn’t have an expiration date. OCTOBER 30, 2021 My heart feels irritated. Today, I have nothing to write on my computer. My fingers flick over to the old, bookmarked link of my acting portfolio. As the website loads, my heart starts pounding. The pictures appear one at a time. I scroll down and see old headshots and performance screen grabs. I am 17, 19, and 20. I am smiling, poised, concealing the hurt. I am being what they need me to be — their thoughts, opinions and desires. I inhale shortly and close my laptop. I am remorseful that I couldn’t protect that little girl. That girl who fell in love with the stage. The girl who learnt how to finesse technique, to hit the mark consistently, to access unknowing depths within her. But writing about that girl and restructuring her narrative, I have a greater agency over my past and present. I have allowed myself to gain autonomy through creative expression. These words have saved my life. Neha Maqsood is a writer and poet.

FOOTBALL: GIRLS KICKING MOUNTAINS,"The ground faces the barren mountains of Quetta in Hazara Town — it feels like an otherworldly place, one where seeing girls in public is a common sight. The girls warm up for their football match under the infinite blue sky on a Sunday morning. Wearing black, beige and pink scarves and shorts with leggings, the players are enthusiastic and ready to play. As the match begins, the atmosphere charges up — someone kicks the football, another teammate shouts an instruction, there’s a cheer here and a sigh there — and soon there’s a goal to great celebration! These were scenes from the Women’s Football Academy when Eos visited — it is one of the only three football academies for women in Hazara Town, Quetta, according to Zahra Afzal, the founder. Zahra, 26, started playing football professionally five years ago. She has played football championships in Karachi and was also a part of the Under-18 team in the National Games. A sports aficionado and a bronze medalist in lawn tennis, Zahra also plays badminton, hockey and cricket. But football is her favourite. Zahra Afzal runs the Women’s Football Academy in Hazara Town, Quetta. What made her get into such an apparently thankless job? “Once you start playing football, you forget all other games,” she tells Eos. Although her passion for football began in childhood, she couldn’t play professionally because of a lack of football academies for women in Hazara Town. After graduating from Sardar Bahadur Khan Womens’ University with a degree in media sciences, Zahra started working as a coordinator in the Aria Institute of Medical Science and decided to start her own academy. It has not been easy for Zahra to start an academy in Quetta, especially in Hazara Town. “There’s no government support, especially for the women’s team. There are no sponsors here, unlike in the big cities, such as Karachi and Lahore,” she shares, adding that, even after two years of starting out, they still have no sponsors. With a lack of support, Zahra deals with the logistics of keeping the academy running on her own. “The ground rent is expensive — it costs 800 rupees per hour,” she points out. “We use the ground daily for two hours.” There’s a monthly fee of Rs500 charged from the players, but for those who cannot afford to pay, especially orphans, the fee is exempted. The day starts early for the players — they train for two hours every day from 6am to 8am. Sundays are match days. Almost 35 girls train at Zahra’s academy — most of them are studying in government schools and are children of Afghan immigrants. When news of the government’s plans to deport Afghan refugees started circulating, many of the players stopped attending training. “Their families would ask them to not go, fearing that they’d be picked up and deported,” Zahra shares. She adds that two of her best players dropped out due to these fears. Sakina Nazari, 17, wasn’t interested in football three months ago but now she dreams of pursuing a career in football. She was persuaded by a friend, who trains at the same academy, to start playing. “Football is like therapy and is also good for fitness,” Sakina tells Eos. “I get a nice feeling when I play — it feels as if I have some control over something. When I wasn’t playing football and stayed at home, I would have a general sense of lethargy, but since I started playing, I feel healthy.” Sakina’s comments about football being therapeutic resonate with many Hazara girls. In recent years, football has emerged as a game-changer for Hazara girls, as it offers solace to the persecuted-community. For a long time, the Hazaras have been discriminated against, targeted by attacks and killed in bombings. In the last 14 years, more than 2,000 Hazaras have been reportedly killed, according to a report published by the National Commission of Human Rights Pakistan. “As a Hazara I might not be able to make it far in football due to discrimination and lack of opportunities for our community, but I still want to give sports my best. We should be judged solely on the basis of our talent,” she adds. While her family has been supportive, Sakina says society in general is very close-minded. “When we go out in our tracksuits, we get weird glares and are subjected to judgement.” Sometimes resistance comes from families too. In such cases, Zahra conducts meetings with the parents to convince them to allow their girls to play. Zahra shares that her vision is to not only train the girls in football but also to “train them for life”, so that they’re ready to face any challenge. Players from her academy have travelled to different cities and out of town for tournaments — an experience that has added to their confidence. “More than the training, these events help them grow.” The 34th National Games of Pakistan were hosted by Quetta last year and some six players from Zahra’s academy were selected to represent Balochistan. Aliya Shuja, 19, said she wants the government to invest in football. “It’s an important sport that’s played internationally. We have so far only been focused on investing in and promoting cricket,” she points out. “If the government would promote football, the youth would not go for drugs or bad deeds,” she says, adding that they just need support and facilities from the government and are willing to pay a fee to train on government-supported grounds that have world-class training facilities. Aliya has been playing football for a long time but has been training at the academy for a month now. Her favourite football team is FC Barcelona and she looks up to Alexia Putellas, a Spanish footballer. “I want to play in international leagues and make a career out of football,” she says. Dua Zahra, 15, was inspired by her father, a football coach. “I want to be a keeper and my dad trained me at home,” shares Dua, who has been playing at the academy for a year now. Although her father is supportive of her dreams to pursue football as a career, her paternal grandmother often tells her football is not for girls. “I just ignore what she says and continue playing,” says Dua giggling.

"SOUNDSCAPE: AND NOW, AI MUSIC","In March, we saw the launch of a “ChatGPT for music” called Suno, which uses generative AI to produce realistic songs on demand from short text prompts. A few weeks later, a similar competitor — Udio — arrived on the scene. I’ve been working with various creative computational tools for the past 15 years, both as a researcher and a producer, and the recent pace of change has floored me. As I’ve argued elsewhere, the view that AI systems will never make “real” music like humans do should be understood more as a claim about social context than technical capability. The argument, “Sure, it can make expressive, complex-structured, natural-sounding, virtuosic, original music that can stir human emotions, but AI can’t make proper music,” can easily begin to sound like something from a Monty Python sketch. AI can now generate entire songs on demand. What does this mean for music as we know it? After playing with Suno and Udio, I’ve been thinking about what it is exactly they change — and what they might mean not only for the way professionals and amateur artists create music, but the way all of us consume it. Expressing emotion without feeling it Generating audio from text prompts in itself is nothing new. However, Suno and Udio have made an obvious development: from a simple text prompt, they generate song lyrics (using a ChatGPT-like text generator), feed them into a generative voice model, and integrate the “vocals” with generated music to produce a coherent song segment. This integration is a small but remarkable feat. The systems are very good at making up coherent songs that sound expressively “sung” (there I go anthropomorphising). The effect can be uncanny. I know it’s AI, but the voice can still cut through with emotional impact. When the music performs a perfectly executed end-of-bar pirouette into a new section, my brain gets some of those little sparks of pattern-processing joy that I might get listening to a great band. To me this highlights something sometimes missed about musical expression: AI doesn’t need to experience emotions and life events to successfully express them in music that resonates with people. Music as an everyday language Like other generative AI products, Suno and Udio were trained on vast amounts of existing work by real humans — and there is much debate about those humans’ intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, these tools may mark the dawn of mainstream AI music culture. They offer new forms of musical engagement that people will just want to use, to explore, to play with and actually listen to for their own enjoyment. AI capable of “end to end” music creation is arguably not technology for makers of music, but for consumers of music. For now, it remains unclear whether users of Udio and Suno are creators or consumers — or whether the distinction is even useful. A long-observed phenomenon in creative technologies is that, as something becomes easier and cheaper to produce, it is used for more casual expression. As a result, the medium goes from an exclusive high art form to more of an everyday language — think what smartphones have done to photography. So imagine you could send your father a professionally produced song all about him for his birthday, with minimal cost and effort, in a style of his preference — a modern-day birthday card. Researchers have long considered this eventuality, and now we can do it. Happy birthday, dad! Can you create without control? Whatever these systems have achieved and may achieve in the near future, they face a glaring limitation: the lack of control. Text prompts are often not much good as precise instructions, especially in music. So these tools are fit for blind search — a kind of wandering through the space of possibilities — but not for accurate control. (That’s not to diminish their value. Blind search can be a powerful creative force.) Viewing these tools as a practising music producer, things look very different. Although Udio’s ‘About’ page says “anyone with a tune, some lyrics, or a funny idea can now express themselves in music”, I don’t feel I have enough control to express myself with these tools. I can see them being useful to seed raw materials for manipulation, much like samples and field recordings. But when I’m seeking to express myself, I need control. Using Suno, I had some fun finding the most gnarly dark techno grooves I could get out of it. The result was something I would absolutely use in a track. But I found I could also just gladly listen. I felt no compulsion to add anything or manipulate the result to add my mark. And many jurisdictions have declared that you won’t be awarded copyright for something just because you prompted it into existence with AI. For a start, the output depends just as much on everything that went into the AI — including the creative work of millions of other artists. Arguably, you didn’t do the work of creation. You simply requested it. New musical experiences in the no-man’s land between production and consumption So Udio’s declaration that anyone can express themselves in music is an interesting provocation. The people who use tools like Suno and Udio may be considered more consumers of music AI experiences than creators of music AI works or, as with many technological impacts, we may need to come up with new concepts for what they’re doing. A shift to generative music may draw attention away from current forms of musical culture, just as the era of recorded music saw the diminishing (but not death) of orchestral music, which was once the only way to hear complex, timbrally rich and loud music. If engagement in these new types of music culture and exchange explodes, we may see reduced engagement in the traditional music consumption of artists, bands, radio and playlists. While it is too early to tell what the impact will be, we should be attentive. The effort to defend existing creators’ intellectual property protections, a significant moral rights issue, is part of this equation. But even if it succeeds, I believe it won’t fundamentally address this potentially explosive shift in culture, and claims that such music might be inferior also have had little effect in halting cultural change historically, as with techno or even jazz, long ago. Government AI policies may need to look beyond these issues to understand how music works socially and to ensure that our musical cultures are vibrant, sustainable, enriching and meaningful for both individuals and communities.

Tax reforms — easier than expected,"The Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) recent decision to block the mobile SIMs of 506,671 individuals who failed to file their tax returns for 2023 as a penalty is a controversial move that telecom operators may challenge in courts. It is yet another example of using diktat to expand the tax net and improve tax collection instead of introducing systemic reforms based on best international practices. Earlier on April 1, 2024, the FBR initiated a mandatory tax registration scheme for retailers and wholesalers in six major cities. Major commercial cities like Faisalabad, Multan, and Sialkot were conspicuously left out. The FBR gave traders one month to register by April 30. Less than 100 traders reportedly registered during April. The number of retailers/traders is estimated to be around three million in the country. Pakistan has been trying to reform the tax system for decades, but the tax-to-GDP ratio has remained low. Meanwhile, low-income developing countries have made progress, with the average tax-to-GDP ratios increasing by about 3.5 percentage points since the early 1990s to 13.8 per cent in 2020.  The World Bank committed $103m in 2004 to a tax administration reform project. However, according to their website, an independent evaluation rating in 2012 showed the outcome to be unsatisfactory. Another World Bank program with a commitment of $350m was approved in December 2023, but it has also made no progress. Pakistan could increase its tax-to-GDP ratio without foreign assistance via Nadra’s stores of information, and an honest will to improve Tax collections grew by just 4pc in real terms — adjusted for inflation — during five years from FY18 to FY23 at an annual average of just 0.81pc. Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio fell from 10.4pc in 2017-18 to 8.5pc in 2022-23, far below the Asia and Pacific average of 19.8pc. The shocking lack of progress is mystifying for a country that has gone to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) a record number of 24 times and received millions of dollars from the World Bank to reform its tax administration. Is it incompetence, lack of intent, or a combination of both? As a first step toward reforming the tax system, the government should entrust the job of policymaking tax and regulation to a separate body of public finance specialists, and the role of the generalists in the FBR should be limited to execution and operating matters. Many countries have benefited from the experience of East Asian countries and followed their policies. Some key features of successful reform programmes include subjecting the discretionary powers of the tax authorities to legislative oversight and legal checks and balances, reducing the overall number of taxes to a few, and slashing maximum rates, as high rates have historically encouraged tax evasion. Moreover, rebates, exemptions and special treatments are eliminated or reduced, and finally, tax administration is simplified using technology. According to a World Bank study published in 2020, improvements in the tax administration of over a 100 countries were largely driven by technological advances, specifically the implementation of electronic filing and payment systems. In 2004, only 43 economies had an online system for filing and paying taxes. Fifteen years later, more than twice as many did.  Developing countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia started using technology to improve their tax collection as early as 2001, 2002, and 2004, respectively. Pakistan does not need McKinsey to help automate the FBR’s tax collection. The firm, though widely known for its management consulting practice, can hardly claim technology as its core competence. According to reports published by The New York Times, The Economist, and other respected international papers, McKinsey has been involved in numerous corruption scandals, questionable practices, and lawsuits related to insider trading from the United States (US) to South Africa. Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio fell to 8.5pc in 2022-23, far below the Asia and Pacific average of 19.8pc Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) has a wealth of experience and technological expertise to help FBR automate its systems. It can get help, if needed, from technology companies who have experience doing similar projects in other Asian countries. Pakistan needs to introduce an integrated digital system through which records of interest and dividend payments made by financial institutions to companies and individuals would be linked to the tax system. This is a widely followed international norm. To introduce a digital tax regime, the National Tax Number (NTN) should be the same as the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) number of individuals without requiring the individuals to register. NTN/CNIC should be linked to the financial system through technology, as is the practice in the US, UK, Canada, Singapore, and many other countries. At the end of every year, all interest or dividend-paying institutions must communicate the total payment (interest and dividend) made to each recipient, including tax withheld, to the tax authority with the NTN as the reference. To ensure that the financial institutions have correct and valid mailing addresses, over-the-counter delivery of chequebooks or debit cards or any such payment instrument should not be allowed. This delivery must take place through the post. This small but critical detail would ensure that the addresses are correct. Proof of address is now a common requirement of banks worldwide to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. All individuals with income greater than the minimum exemption limit should be required to file tax returns and include the details of interest and dividend payments received from the financial institutions. Since these details would have already been communicated by the financial institutions to the FBR, there would be no question of inaccurate reporting. This single step, if properly implemented, would instantly expand the tax net. All tax assessments and correspondence should be available to the income tax filers online through a central portal maintained by the FBR. The FBR should communicate through post or electronic means, and no physical presence of tax filers should be required except in the event of a legal case. These simple but critical measures can dramatically increase tax collections and reduce corruption. Pakistan has nearly 177m bank accounts and around 165m mobile phone users. There is no reason why Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio cannot be increased to catch up with that of other Asian countries in a matter of a few years. This has been done in so many countries. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, just the will and intention to execute.

Echoes of love,"Ever wonder why some guys are just great with everyone? It all starts at home! Exactly, mothers and sons share a powerful bond that goes a very long way in shaping the kind of men they become. It is a special connection like no other! This bond helps shape who a boy grows up to be. A mother’s love and guidance show her son how to be caring and understanding, which helps him build strong relationships throughout his life. A mother becomes a living example of respect and kindness in his life. The way she interacts with everyone, but particularly the men in her life, sets the standard for his son’s behaviour with all the women young or old in his life. By expecting courtesy and consideration, she subtly teaches him that women deserve the same treatment — not as something special, but as fellow human beings. While some mothers show their love with lots of hugs and kisses, that wasn’t exactly my mum’s style. She was more on the strict and disciplined side, therefore, expressing her feelings with words wasn’t always easy for her. However, I never doubted her love. It shone in her eyes — I was her pride and joy. Unlike my dad, mum took charge of making sure things ran smoothly and she was the one who enforced the rules. From a young age, she made sure I knew what was expected of me, both at home and out in the world. Her goal was clear: to raise me into a disciplined, respectful young man who protected others, especially girls in the family and those around me, she made me the one who could go out in the world with kindness and empathy in his heart. However, as time passed, I realised that the rules set by my mother were never illogical or impulsive. They showed how much she cared about me and wanted me to be a strong, capable, responsible and disciplined person. Even though I didn’t like when she suddenly showed her strictness to me, I realise now, it was her way of making me better and stronger for the future. We definitely had our moments, but all those rules and lectures from mum were totally worth it! They made me who I am, and I’m happy with that! There is no doubt that while growing up, most of us, boys and girls, hung out with our mother more than Dad (especially if she happens to be a stay-at-home one). This builds a stronger bond, don’t you think so? Like, you come home from school and who’s there asking a million questions about your day? Your mother, of course! Plus, she’s always dropping wisdom bombs on you, casually, at dinner, or while you’re helping out in the kitchen that very few of us could understand. And as far as I can remember, those wisdom bombs were mostly about respect — respect for myself, respect for others and, most importantly, respect for women. She instilled in me gender equality and the inherent worth of every human being, regardless of their gender. There is no doubt that my father was there to show me the world from a male perspective, but my mother showed me the tenderness and the emotional depth of everything that I missed or failed to notice as a male. While my father taught me strength and resilience, my mother added lessons about emotional expression and the ability to connect with others on a human level. Thanks to her, I’m not just a walking brick wall — I can understand others and express my emotions, too!  Boys may not always express their sensitivity or emotions openly; they tend to keep them bottled up inside. Despite being hurt or upset; they often feel pressure not to show it because of societal expectations about masculinity. I consider myself fortunate because my mother understood this. She recognised the turmoil I was experiencing inside, the façade I tried to keep as I grew up. I remember back in my childhood days, one day I came home from school feeling upset because a classmate had teased me during recess. My face was all red in anger, I ran straight to my mum. Instead of immediately solving the problem, she let me express my feelings fully. Once I had calmed down, she said, “I know it hurts when someone is unkind, but your reaction shows you have a tender heart. That tenderness allows you to understand how others feel.” She gently wiped my tears and continued, “Don’t let anyone make you feel bad about having empathy. It’s a gift that will help you form deep connections in life.” My mother taught me that tenderness and emotional depth are strengths, not weaknesses. From her, I learned to appreciate my ability to feel deeply instead of suppressing it. It also helped me become more emotionally aware and in tune with myself and my other siblings. Now that I am an adult, I carry the legacy of my mother’s teachings like a precious torch, lighting up my path wherever I go. Many kids and youngsters don’t like when their parents give them instructions or tell them to follow the rules, but I accepted and followed. Whether it was making my bed every morning or completing my homework before playtime, my mother’s insistence on discipline taught me responsibility and time management. Yes, undoubtedly, there were also times when I grumbled and protested, but all grown up now, I realise that those small tasks laid the foundation for success in all areas of my life. My mother is not in my life anymore, and I long to feel the comfort of her touch one more time. I long to hear her words of encouragement and wisdom once more. But you can express and cherish the presence of your parents in your life. Waste no minute, because we are the joy of our parents. Knowing that we care about them gives them strength and happiness. Therefore, even as adults, it’s crucial to express our love and care for our parents. Both mother and father hold a special place in our lives. They need to be acknowledged and appreciated. I admit, as kids, teens and even adults, we can be selfish, often prioritising our desires without considering our parents’ feelings. There are occasions when we may prioritise our father, but we tend to take our mother for granted. Why? Because we believe she will never mind, always forgive and easily forget. Isn’t it an injustice? Remember kids, our mother is the one who knows us from the core of our hearts, our good and bad, our strengths and weaknesses, because she was the one who gave us birth. She held us carefully and gently in her arms, remained up all night to comfort us when we cried for hours, and her tired, restless body with pure love kept trying to soothe and give us comfort forgetting all about her in providing us. Dear mother, sometimes I wish I could rewind life. There’s so much I’d tell you. First and foremost, how much your love means to me. You were my guide, teaching me right from wrong, even when it meant sacrificing your own comfort. All those late nights, all the things you gave up — they built the foundation of who I am today. And for that, I can’t thank you enough. There’s a part of me that aches knowing I never truly expressed how grateful I was for your endless prayers, and whispered wishes for my happiness that echoed through the years. Because of you, mother, a part of me will always believe I can achieve anything. Thanks for whispering that into my heart all through the years.

Mailbox," The blessed iftar This is with reference to the article “The blessed iftar experience” by Shahmeer Asif (YW, March 23rd). The article highlighted the true meaning of togetherness. It showed how during iftar, people come together, feeling love and kindness, regardless of their caste or status. This simple mealtime is important both religiously and in terms of human connection. It brings people from different cultures and classes closer, creating strong bonds and cherished memories among family members. Musadique Ali,

Sukkur Moonlit memories This is regarding the story “Moonlit memories,” by Aliza Hina (YW, March 16). The story was a great reminder to all those who often forget to appreciate what they have in the present while dwelling in the past.

Karachi Rabia keeps a fast This is regarding the article “Rabia keeps a fast,” by Muhammad Arham Usman (YW, March 30).  The story depicted a real-life scenario that often occurs to both new and experienced individuals who are fasting. Oftentimes, one forgets that they are fasting and unintentionally eat or drink something. However, as the story conveyed, the fast is not broken but remains intact, if done mistakenly. Moreover, I agree with the writer’s view that fasting teaches us self-control and reinforces one’s faith and piety. Mehtab Ali Lakhan,
Ghotki II The story “Rabia keeps a fast” by Muhammad Arham Usman highlighted that if we accidentally break our fast, there’s no need to cry. Instead, one must ask for forgiveness from God because the fast is still valid. Fasting is for Allah; He knows our intentions. Allah is very merciful; He knows what is in our heart and can see how regretful we are. Mirza Atta,

Mother’s Day: A letter to my mum," As-salaam Alaikum, Maa, I hope this letter finds you in good spirits. Startled you with my letter, right? And you are wondering what on earth has made me write a letter when I could have simply messaged you or called you up. And I know, fumbling with anxiety, you have checked your phone by now to see if you had missed my calls or messages. So let me assure you, everything is fine Maa, please do not fret. And keep reading this. You know, this time I wanted to do something really special for you on Mother’s Day. First, I thought of gifting you those emerald earrings you longed to have, the ones whose picture you have saved in your phone’s gallery for ages. Or buy you a pair of comfy shoes that will help you walk around, doing the household chores easily. But then I realised that these materialistic things will not reveal my love for you until I express it myself. Let me put it straight — for me, Mother’s Day is not meant to be celebrated on only one day of the year, every day is Mother’s Day.  How? Because I cannot imagine a day without your presence. The very thought of life without you makes my heart skip a beat. My day kick-starts when each morning you wake me up for the Fajr prayers and I see warmth, wisdom and love emanating from your beautiful countenance. The reason why I exist today is because you didn’t let go of believing in me. It’s your resilience, courage, prayers and unconditional love that has given me the vigour to embrace the adversities of my life fearlessly. On days when the worries of tomorrow overwhelm me and make it impossible for me to climb out of bed, your counseling helps me rise and muster up the strength to combat the challenges of the world. You are not only my mother, but you are also my best friend, my North Star and my greatest motivator. When the hardships of my life seem to be unbearable, it’s in your arms that I find solace. When I am all lost and unable to make a decision, your words of wisdom show me the direction and help me stay focused. When situations get tough and I am on the verge of giving up, it’s your constant reminders to remain steadfast and have strong faith in the Almighty, that prevents me from relinquishing my objectives. Above all, you are my greatest well-wisher. After scooping accolades, when I return home all elated and brimming with joy, you are the first one to embrace me and rejoice at my success. As I sit at my desk, penning down my sentiments, I can’t help recalling the love and devotion with which you have taught me when I was little. The patience and dedication with which you have coached me have not only helped me soar in my academics, but also in all the endeavours of my life. The values and morals you have instilled in me have guided me, helped me distinguish between right and wrong, and have thus shaped my entire personality. The greatest achievement for me is when people praise me for taking after you, and I am all the more grateful to Allah for blessing me with such an amazing mother. You have always been my true protector and guide, ever since my birth. How can I not recount the numerous sleepless nights you’ve spent by my bed, praying for my health whenever I have fallen ill, or the anxiousness with which you have waited for me, after school and outside the examination halls? The most incredible part is that though this little daughter of yours is now a grown-up, your love for her has not faded away, instead it has amplified. Even today, I can see the anxiousness in your eyes when I am late from work, can feel the worry in your voice when I am unable to respond to your calls, and can discern your endearment when you cook delectable food items, especially for me. Maa, you have been a saviour throughout the ebbs and flows of my life’s struggles. The reason why I exist today is because you didn’t let go of believing in me. It’s your resilience, courage, prayers and unconditional love that has given me the vigour to embrace the adversities of my life fearlessly. Whether I needed a shoulder to cry on or a friend to confide in, an expert to offer me advice, or a buddy to celebrate my minuscule accomplishments, Maa, you have executed all these roles, flawlessly! I know no matter how hard I try, I can never be able to repay you for the amount of sacrifices you have made for me and for the unfaltering care, support and unconditional love you have showered on me. Nevertheless, with utmost gratitude, I pray to the Almighty Allah to bless you with abundant health and happiness, today and always. Ameen Happy Mother’s Day, Maa! Love you to the moon and back!
Your ever-loving daughter. Published in Dawn, Young World, May 11th, 2024",https://www.dawn.com/news/1832756/mothers-day-a-letter-to-my-mum
The Agrarian Thespian,"Samiya Mumtaz’s characters are often quiet, although her on-screen presence is anything but subdued. Known for her exceptional acting abilities, she captivates audiences with nuanced performances, whether portraying powerful characters like Saba Kareem in Meri Zaat Zarra-e-Benishan or subtly drawing attention as Udaari’s Sajo. Beyond the realm of acting, Samiya Mumtaz’s true passion lies in sustainable farming. Raised in an environment where creativity and social consciousness were valued, Mumtaz was drawn to the arts from a young age. ’’I did a lot of acting because my school encouraged it,“ she recalls. ’’And at home, my phuppo would write plays and we were the guinea pigs who would act them out.“ These early forays into acting ignited a spark and kicked off her acting career with the Ajoka Theatre, the voice of revolt against the establishment in Lahore. She also held a day job working with a research organisation. However, while acting provided an avenue for creative expression and her research work gave her profound satisfaction, a deeper yearning for a connection to nature and a desire to make an impact on society led her down the path of sustainable farming. “I grew up with a romanticised vision of living on a farm,” she smiles. “At 14, I daydreamed about going to fetch water and chirping with the birds. It was a pipe dream, but I held onto it, even as I pursued other endeavours.” While working at the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme, she found herself surrounded by voices urging her to turn her dreams into reality. “Why do you think this is just a dream? Why don’t you make it happen?” her friends queried. She sought guidance from a friend with a business background who helped her write out a feasibility study for an organic farm. Next, she immersed herself in learning traditional farming methods from farmers in her community. “I did not have an agricultural background and learnt along the way about techniques such as intercropping, composting, and green manuring.” As she navigated the complexities of farming on less-than-ideal land, her passion for nurturing the earth grew stronger. “The land I had was very saline and it was a challenge,” she admits.  But she did turn the land around and then started an organic food business called Daali Earth. For Mumtaz, the decision to pursue acting alongside farming was a deliberate choice born out of financial necessity and a desire to balance her responsibilities. “My day job was satisfying, but I was not able to save much from what I earned,” she acknowledges. As a single mother with two children, she needed another source of income. In the end, she found solace in the balance, viewing each endeavour as a complementary expression of her creativity and commitment to making an impact. Reflecting on her experience in the local film industry, she remarks that “films barely have any existence in this country,” but acknowledges the challenges. “Pakistani films are made from the money people have in their pockets.” In a market dominated by international giants, Pakistani cinema struggles to compete, hindered by unaffordable ticket prices and limited accessibility. Mumtaz’s heart remains tethered to the stage, where the presence of a live audience breathes life into her performances. “My preferred medium is the stage with a live audience, any day,” she asserts while talking about a recent stage performance called The Story of Malika Pukhraj on the life of the legendary singer. Speaking about her venture into sustainable farming, she dwells on her dedication to organic practices and refusal to compromise on quality. From tilling the soil by hand to nurturing heirloom seeds, she is committed to organic practices, eschewing chemical inputs in favour of holistic, sustainable methods. However, despite her best efforts, the business faced several hurdles, including a limited market and financial constraints. As the challenges mounted and profitability remained elusive, she made the difficult decision to sell Daali Earth, recognising that scaling up would necessitate compromises she was unwilling to make.  Although she may have exited the business world, Mumtaz’s passion for sustainable living remains. Today, she finds joy in tending to her farm, cultivating organic crops, and embracing the agrarian life. “There is great pleasure in picking your own vegetables and cooking them in your own oil.” Her days remain filled with purpose and productivity. Her mornings begin around six, and it is during these tranquil hours that she tends to the farm and engages in tasks like churning butter, fermenting vegetables, and making jams. “And if there is a TV shoot, I usually go there after my farm work is done.” Samiya Mumtaz’s journey is an inspiration for those who dare to pursue their passions against the odds. Through her dedication to both acting and sustainable farming, she exemplifies the power of resilience, creativity, and a commitment to living authentically.
